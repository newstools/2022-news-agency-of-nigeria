By Emmanuel Mogbede The United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) in Nigeria has advised the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure that 2023 general election was peaceful and inclusive. Mr Serge Kubwimana, UN Team Leader and Senior Political Affairs Officer, said this when he led a delegation of UNEAD on a visit to the APC national secretariat on Wednesday in Abuja. Kubwinmana said the visit was to seek for collaboration with the APC toward a peaceful and inclusive electoral process. He said that Nigeria had strong institutions and the ability to run its elections. “We are the UNEAD which is in Nigeria as a result of a request for electoral support for the UN to assess the overall context which the election will take place. “We are to see in what form we could potentially bring our small contribution to the 2023 elections. “We have conferred with the APC national secretary on behalf of the national chairman and we have done the same with other stakeholders such as INEC, government and civil society organisations,” Kubwimana said. He said the group had also met with other political parties, faith based organisations as well as the Inter-party Advisory Council toward ensuring a peaceful poll. The APC National Secretary, Sen. Iyiola Omisore who received the delegation on behalf of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, said the party’s national chairman expressed appreciation for the visit. (NAN)
