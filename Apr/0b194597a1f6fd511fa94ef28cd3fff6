The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the ECOWAS Commission on Monday in Abuja organised a High-level Seminar to discuss with Member countries on the modalities of allocating the equipment for effective operations. The boats and equipment were provided under the EU-funded ECOWAS project tagged the Support to West Africa Integrated Maritime Security (SWAIMS) project, a multi-component, regional initiative implemented in all 15 ECOWAS countries. Col. Abdourahmane Dieng, the Head of ECOWAS’ Regional Security Division said that Maritime insecurity had long been one of the most persistent and intractable threats to maritime communities and economic prosperity in West Africa. Dieng, however, said that West African countries requires a whole of coordinated response to tackle the scourge of attacks, piracy and armed robberies against the vessels. “For that we have developed an ECOWAS integrated maritime strategy around five pillars to ensure security in the fifteen member states within ECOWAS maritime domain. “And also reinforce our capacity in terms of managing our maritime environment and also developing our capacity in terms of blue economy, and also develop our culture in terms of maritime. “We are receiving support from our partners, the main partners coming in is the European Union and today we are also here together with SWAIMS to try to capacitate the member states. “By providing them with Rigid Inflatable boats that are allow the Member states to fight against illegal fishing through some paroling in the maritime domain. “Today, all the Member States are represented by their relevant agencies and also representative to discuss draft an agreement for the sharing of the Rigid Inflatable boats. “And also try to develop the modalities of the way to capacitate the member states to be able to use them today,” Dieng said. Dr Axel Klien, SWAIMS Representative said that the Seminar was part of a wider programme to support Maritime security in the ECOWAS region. Klien said that the Rigid Hull Inflateable Boats would be provided to Navy and coast guards of all 12 coastal ECOWAS Member States and the provision of equipment to the maritime operation centers. This he explained would help to curb maritime crimes and piracy which had ravaged the coastal lines of ECOWAS Countries. “There are different types of Maritime crimes, there are piracy and armed robbery, there are also illegal fishing, and there is the trade in illicit goods. “So, against all these crimes, the coat guards, the police, the law enforcement agencies, the prosecuting services, they need to be provided with equipment. “What we are talking about today here is providing to ECOWAS, with funding from the European Union are thirty digital inflatable boats that can go out into the sea and catch the perpetuators. “And, also the forensic equipment and communications and other equipment that will help the maritime centers coordinate these operations. “If you look at the numbers of piracy incidents in these regions, you will find that all the different efforts buy navies and coast guards and international partners have been successful in reducing the numbers. “So, we need to build on that success by strengthening the security system that is in place at the moment. “International cooperation is critical and here is why ECOWAS is playing a valuable role for its multinational coordination centers, the exchange of information and the coordination of expenses,” Klien said. Amb. Joao Almeida, President Camoes Institute, who lauded the programme said, the institution was excited to have been charged by the European Union to implement the project. Almedia expressed optimism that the boats and equipment when handed over would achieve its purpose of combatting all forms of maritime crimes in the region. “We have been charged by the European Union to be the implementors of the project that we are going to have here. “We are going to discuss how to go ahead with the MOU among the 12 states of ECOWAS,” Almedia said.
