Adamu who occupied the seat before, recently resigned after emerging as the national chairman of the APC at its March 26, National Convention. Wadada said his chances at emerging victorious in the election was bright as a man of the people with vast political and administrative experience. “If you limit me to the private sector alone, you are not doing justice to my blessings, neither are you doing justice to my people. “I am have both public and private sector experience and the National Assembly will not be a new place to me. I was a member of the fifth and sixth assemblies. “And, my representation was well felt. I impacted as much as I could, not only to my Federal Constituency, or to my state alone, but to Nigeria as a whole,” he said. The aspirant added that given the proximity of the state to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), he would address its socio political problems of the state. Wadada, who holds the traditional title of Sarkin Yakin Keffi Emirate, said he would also put in place enabling laws to deepen, diversify and grow the economy well-being of the people of the state. Wadada said he was well prepared for the election since it was going to be about the people. “I have been with the people, I have always related and aligned with them, I have always associated and supported and assisted my people, so I am a man of the people. <img src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FB_IMG_1651236175859-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-42970" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FB_IMG_1651236175859-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FB_IMG_1651236175859-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FB_IMG_1651236175859.jpg 837w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> “As far as Nasarawa West Senatorial District is concerned, I am the man to beat,” he stressed.
