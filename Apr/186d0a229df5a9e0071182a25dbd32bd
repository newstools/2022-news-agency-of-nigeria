By Oluwafunke Ishola The International Facility Management Association of Nigeria says assent of the National Public Buildings Maintenance Policy will positively impact the sustainability of government’s infrastructure projects. The President of the Chapter, Mr Segun Adebayo, said this in a statement on Monday in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that President Muhammadu Buhari on April 6 assented the Executive Order 11 on National Public Buildings Maintenance Policy. The executive order now ties maintenance of the Federal Government owned buildings directly to the economy and would ensure that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), operate a functional maintenance department. It also prescribed that they make necessary procurement in line with the responsibilities. Adebayo, who commended the government for the assent, noted that the policy was long overdue as it would optimise the enormous investment in public infrastructure. He said that with the action, the professional management and maintenance of government’s assets was assured and guaranteed. “Our association is committed to collaborating with the Federal Government through the relevant ministry to provide required capacity building and knowledge development. “This is even as we earnestly look forward to the implementation of the provisions of the new order through the setting up of the maintenance department in MDAs. “As an association, we have been advocating the integration of sustainable practices into the built environment and this has started yielding the desired results,” he said. He also commended the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, for the feat, noting that his efforts in the ministry had yielded phenomenal results. (NAN)
