By Kelechi Ogunleye The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has said that security have been beefed up across the country for the Easter celebration. This is contained in a statement issued by the NSCDC Public Relations Officer, Mr Olusola Odumosu and released to newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Odumosu, NSCDC Commandant General (CG), Ahmed Audi, ordered the massive deployment of personnel from State, Zonal Commands and the National Headquarters to suspected flash points. He said that the deployed personnel are to strengthen security in places of worship, recreational facilities, markets, shopping malls, parks, gardens and other densely populated areas. “This is to guard against unwanted activities of criminals whose intention is to sabotage government efforts. “And also to cause mayhem as Christians commemorate the crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ,” he said. He said that there are new security measures in place to forestall any breach of peace during the celebration. “The activities of terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other similar groups in the country portends serious dangers for the country. “Hence, the need for more drastic strategic action in order to prevent the manifestation of various threats being unleashed by the enemies of the country,” he said. Odumosu said the CG advised State Commandants to include Private Security Guards (PSG) in security arrangements for broad nooks and crannies coverage. He felicitated with all Christian faithfuls on the Easter celebration, assuring that the NSCDC in synergy with other security agencies would work tirelessly towards a hitch-free celebration. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Federal Government had declared Friday, April 15 and Monday, April 18 as public holidays to celebrate Easter. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
