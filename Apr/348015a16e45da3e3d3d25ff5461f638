By Salisu Sani-Idris Alhaji Yakubu Saidu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Masarki Nigeria Ltd., a construction company, has cautioned some politicians in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) against dragging his name into the council’s politics. Saidu issued the warning on Monday in a statement by the firm’s Chief of Engineering Services, Mr Shittu Chidawa. Saidu, in the statement, threatened that dragging his name into the council’s politics would have “severe consequences if it continued.” “I call on some group of politicians under the auspices of the Coalition of Non-indigenes and Indigenes For Peace in AMAC (CNIFPA) not to drag me into their dirty politics. “The group should know that Saidu is a renowned business tycoon of international repute, who has never contested for any political position,“ the statement said. CNIFPA, however,  is accusing Saidu of sponsoring APC supporters in court to upturn the victory of the PDP chairmanship candidate in the AMAC election, Mr Christopher Zaka. Zaka, the chairman-elect, has been accused of certificate forgery. CNIFPA said APC has no justification to challenge PDP`s victory “because the entire process was free, fair and credible“. Saidu, however, pointed out that he had at time joined politics and should not be erroneously tagged a politician. “I want to urge the general public, particularly our clients, not to fall into their trap. “Their mission is to drag us into the mud. The public should take note of these political saboteurs,“ the statement said. Saidu also urged members of the public to be very meticulous with such groups and their activities. “We also warn those behind these devilish activities to be careful and to leave my name and company out. “We will go to any length to deal with anybody, no matter how highly placed or well connected, if the smearing of the name of Saidu continued,“ the statement said.
