Georgia and Moldova received their questionnaires to join the European Union (EU) from EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi, an important moment at the start of a long entry process. The document was “the first step on your European path,’’ Varhelyi told Georgia’s Foreign Minister Ilia Darchiashvili at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. The document served as the basis for EU accession talks for applicants. Moldova and Georgia applied for membership in the bloc after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine also applied for entry in view of the Russian invasion. In a gesture of solidarity, European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen personally delivered a questionnaire to Kiev last Friday.
