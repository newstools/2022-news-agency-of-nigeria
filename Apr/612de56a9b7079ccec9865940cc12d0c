By Stanley Nwanosike The Movement for Election of Nigerian President of Igbo Extraction, a political pressure group, has hailed Gov. Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra for nominating commissioners-designate just in two weeks of his inauguration. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Soludo was sworn in on March 17 as the governor of Anambra after he won with a landslide victory during the gubernatorial election on Nov. 6. The Convener of the movement, Mr Vincent Ezekwueme, told NAN in Enugu on Sunday that early nomination of the commissioners-designate shows that Soludo was adequately prepared for the task of governance. Ezekwueme said that it was worth of note that he appointed “square pegs in  square holes”. He said, “It is good that Soludo sees himself as Governor of Anambra, where every citizen has equal stake, rights and opportunities. “I appeal to Soludo to involve civil society organisations in his administration and subsequent appointments as they will always tell him what he needs to know and do, not what he wants to know and hear”. Ezekwueme also called on the Anambra State House of Assembly to expedite action towards confirming the commissioners-designate in record time to facilitate quick actualisation of lofty goals of the state by Soludo administration. “The commissioners should see their appointments as an avenue to serve and not to be served and amass wealth, power and fame. “They should always listen to cries, problems and predicament of the residents and visitors in order to restore people’s confidence and trust in government,” he added.
