By Ruth Oketunde Prof. Muhammed Isah, Chairman, Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), has advised public officers to desist from diverting public wealth to their personal pockets. He gave the advice at a one-day workshop, organised for staff of the Pharmacist Council of Nigeria (PCN), on Friday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the workshop was on strict compliance with assets declaration and code of conduct for public officers. Isah, represented by Prof. Samuel Ogundare, Federal Commissioner, Education and Advocacy Services at the Bureau, said it was important for public officers to maintain high level of integrity as they carry out government activities. “Public officers are key to public administration and that is why you were carefully selected in terms of your education, skill and experience. “That is why you have been given the legal backing to carry out your duties as well as conducive environment to discharge your responsibilities. “So, having given you much like this, government expects that you discharge your responsibilities effectively and efficiently, by doing things right. “And how you deploy these wealth is important to the government, rather than deploying it to personal pockets, other wise known as corruption,” he said. On his part, Mr Elijah Mohammed, Registrar, Pharmacist Council of Nigeria (PCN), urged the participants to be objective and accountable as they carry out their duties. “What this thing is all about is objectivity, sincerity and accountability and by so doing you will be able to account for certain things for yourself. “You will find out that you are helping yourself to take stock of yourself as nobody is witch-hunting us and the watch word is accountability,” he added.
