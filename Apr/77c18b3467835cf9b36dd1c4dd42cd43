The UN Human Rights Office has said the evidence of war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine is mounting. Russian forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and destroying hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, the Geneva-based agency said on Friday. In addition to indiscriminate attacks and the denial of medical aid, there were hundreds of reports of arbitrary killings and sexual violence. If proven, such acts amount to war crimes. “There already has been a blood bath. “We are very worried about what is coming next. “Even wars have rules and they need to be respected,’’ spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said. The April 8 attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk, in which cluster munitions killed 60 civilians, showed that the principles of international humanitarian law were being ignored. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet added. There was also growing evidence of indiscriminate killings, including in Bucha, the suburb of the capital Kiev. Civilians were being held against them would and there were reports of torture, ill-treatment and abductions, the agency said. Bachelet appealed to all sides to respect international humanitarian law. This includes, among other things, that a distinction is made between military and civilian personnel, that civilians are not targeted and that no one is tortured.
