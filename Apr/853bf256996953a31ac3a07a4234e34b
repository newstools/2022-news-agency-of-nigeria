The labour dispute that resulted to picketing of the headquarters of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) by the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) on Monday has been resolved.   The dispute was resolved on Wednesday in Abuja after an exhaustive meeting between the management of NAN and the National President of NUJ, Mr Chris Isiguzo as well as the FCT NUJ Council Chairman, Mr Emmanuel Ogbeche.   The dispute arose after the transfer of a NAN member of staff, Mr Collins Yakubu-Hammer, and his refusal to proceed on the transfer over allegations of victimisation.   The meeting, however, resolved that Yakubu-Hammer should immediately report at his duty post at Pankshin in Plateau.   It also resolved that the query and suspension issued to Yakubu-Hammer should be put on hold while NAN management addressed the issues in dispute.   The meeting also resolved that NAN management should take steps to re-instate Yakubu-Hammer’s salaries from Nov. 11, 2021, the day he was suspended.   It further resolved that Yakubu-Hammer should not be victimised on account of his labour-related activities and that he should tender an unreserved apology to NAN management in writing.   The meeting also observed that while transfers in NAN are routine, management should continue with the exercise by ensuring wholesome transfers of all workers who had over-stayed at their current stations.   The management of NAN thanked Isiguzo for his quick intervention in resolving the dispute.
