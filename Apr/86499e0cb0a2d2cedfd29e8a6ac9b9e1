Borehole drillers beg Oyo Govt. to reverse N30,000 permit   By David Adeoye The Association of Water and Borehole Drillers (AWDROP) has appealed to the Oyo State Government to reverse the newly introduced N30,000 permit for borehole drilling in the state.   This is contained in a statement issued in Ibadan by the National President of AWDROP, Mr Michael Ale and made available to newsmen.   Ale, who described Gov. Seyi Makinde as masses friendly, pleaded with him to reverse the policy to avoid worsening the poverty condition of members of the association.   The AWDROP president explained that the current high prices of diesel, gas, petrol and others “is already making life difficult for the people.   “And they do not need any other hostile and stifling policy to worsen the already bad situation.   “The cost of diesel has gone up by 200 per cent, which is taking its toll on the cost of drilling boreholes.   “And many Nigerians without access to safe drinking water have increased to 70 per cent, as against 55 per cent in 2020,” he said.   Ale appealed to the state government to encourage the people to drill boreholes in their quest for safe water.   He noted that many sub-nationals have abandoned water projects at the expense of roads and other physical infrastructures which appear better and more acceptable to the people.   AWDROP president, however, admitted that there was need to regulate drilling operations in the state due to the fact that it has the highest number of drilling rigs, numbering about 109 in the country.   He advised Gov. Makinde to sensitise the people of the state, before implementing the new policy. (NAN)
