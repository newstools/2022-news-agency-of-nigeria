By Ibrahim Kado Mr Haward Iko, Executive Secretary, Primary Healthcare Development Agency of Lamurde Local Government Area, Adamawa, has appealed to Sen. Binos Yaroe, (PDP-Adamawa South) to assist the council in the supply of anti-snake venom. Iko made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lamurde, headquarter of Lamurde Local Government Area of Adamawa on Tuesday. He said that snake bites were one of the challenges faced by the people living in the area as it claimed lives of people annually while the appeal was to include the drug in the zone’s free medical outreach. “We are appealing to Sen. Binos Yaroe to come to our aid by providing us with anti-snakes venom for the treatment of victims of snake bites, especially those living in the riverine and mountainous areas.” According to him, such gesture will add value to the ongoing free medical outreach in the zone which was organised by the senator. He added that without such drugs the council found it difficult to treat the victims of snake bites in the area. “We have to take the victims to as far as Kaltungo Local Government Area in Gombe state for treatment. “Before you realise even on the way going, before reaching to the hospital, anything can happen,” he said. He also said that it would be good for the senator to also provide other drugs to be used in various health facilities to be known as Binos drugs revolving fund. (NAN)
