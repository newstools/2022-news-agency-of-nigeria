Novak Djokovic’s wait for a first title in 2022 continues. This was after he was beaten 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 0-6 by Andrey Rublev in the final of his home ATP tournament in Belgrade on Sunday. Serbian world number one Djokovic has played relatively little this season. This is due to his refusal to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, preventing his participation in various competitions. His run to a first final of the season would have boosted his hopes of a strong French Open in four weeks time though. But he was eventually well beaten by Russia’s Rublev over two hours 26 minutes.
