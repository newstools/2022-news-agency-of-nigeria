By Dorcas Jonah The National Council for Women Societies (NCWS) has called on Nigerians to intensify prayers for the country’s progress as Christians celebrate Easter. The NCWS National President, Hajiya Lami Lau, made the call in Abuja in her Easter message to Christians. According to her, as the world celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the NCWS rejoices with Christians on the occasion. “The period symbolises freedom from all forms of challenge and victory over death; hence, the need for Nigerian women to continue in prayers for God to tackle challenges facing the country. “We need to use this celebration of Easter to pray to God. “I urge you to use the occasion of Easter celebration to promote peace, unity and progress, and imbibe the teachings of Jesus Christ in conduct and relationship with others,” she said. Lau said that the period called for sober reflection due to  attacks on some communities. According to her,  Nigeria  needs divine intervention. “As elections approach, we call on governments to tackle security challenges as we urge all Nigerians to continue in prayers for the nation. “This is what we can do to draw God’s attention to Nigeria,” she said. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
