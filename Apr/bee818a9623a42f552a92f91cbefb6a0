By Fortune Abang A former Minister of Special Duties, Kabiru Turaki, has called on Christians across the country to exemplify the values of Jesus Christ as they celebrate Easter. According to a statement from the Turaki Media Office in Abuja, the former Presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) defined Easter celebration to be a season of peace and unity. “Easter is another opportunity for people of the Christian faith to be their brothers and sisters keepers, as well as work towards the peace and unity of Nigeria and pray for the development of the nation. “Today is a day when we must all reflect on and pray for the way forward for our dear nation, Nigeria.  This is because we are approaching a crucial crossroad which is next year’s general elections. “We must all ask the Almighty God whose reasoning surpasses our understanding for guidance on the way forward,” he said. He, however, noted that as Christians celebrate, Muslim faithful celebrate with them, and together they would work to build a nation that Nigerians would be proud of. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
