By George Odok The All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Lobby Group has started its voter enlightenment campaign across the 18 local government areas of Cross River. The group, led by the member representing Cross River at the national Youth Lobby Group, Mr Asuquo Ekpenyong, began the campaign on Monday in Ogoja local government area of the state. The Group took the campaign to other local government areas in Cross River north including, Bekwara, Obanliku, Obudu, and Yala. At each of the local government areas visited, Ekpenyong met with traditional rulers, and opinion leaders as well as a cross-section of young people. Ekpenyong, who is also the Commissioner for Finance in Cross River, charged the youths to participate en masse in the forthcoming Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended voters registration exercise. He explained that INEC would reopen the continuous voters’ registration exercise on Monday, April 11. He urged young people of eligible voting age in Cross River north to take advantage of the process to register or revalidate their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) in readiness for the 2023 general elections. “I have come to motivate, support, and mobilise you, as the most active segment of our society, to take the electoral process seriously by registering to vote,” he said. The commissioner for finance urged young people to join hands with Gov. Ben Ayade’s drive to reposition the state’s economy. He enjoined youths, men and women including the traditional rulers to register as members of the APC in Cross River with a view to reap the dividends of democratic governance. Speaking, a traditional ruler in Ogoja, Mr Francis Modey, commended the team for leading a statewide campaign to educate the people on electioneering processes. Also speaking, a youth in Bekwarra local government, Mr Emmanuel Otiko, lauded the group for sensitising the rural dwellers on what was expected of them ahead of the 2023 polls. (NAN)
