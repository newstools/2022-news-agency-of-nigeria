By Emmanuel Afonne All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant, Mr Tein Jack-Rich, has urged Christians to always love and forgive one another as a reminder to what Jesus Christ did for mankind at Calvary. Jack-Rich said this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja to celebrate Easter. He said that love was a necessary ingredient for peace as the country moved toward the 2023 general election. Jack-Rich expressed the optimism that the security and other challenges confronting the nation would be a thing of the past as Nigerians joined the rest of the world to commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. “I bring warm wishes of peace and hope to you and your loved ones. “It is my fervent prayer that in this season of sober reflection and celebration, our hearts may find thoughts of peace toward our neighbours and one another. “That we may be patient and forgive one another, support the weak and embrace peace. “In the same vein, as our nation enters the season of transition in the midst of global economic challenges and uncertainties, I equally bring you the message of comfort and hope for a better tomorrow. “The times may be tough but we are tougher together in unity. This is in the strong resolve that the fervent spirit of the Nigerian people can never be shaken,” Jack-Rich said. He urged the Christian faithful to imbibe the virtues of Christ and extend love to all Nigerians for the country to achieve the prosperity it yearns for. “This is a great, beloved and blessed country; always love Nigeria. Pray for Nigeria, believe in Nigeria. “Together we can make history in building the nation of our dreams where love and peace, justice and joy reign. “As you celebrate Easter, may this season be a turnaround in your lives and may the joy of the Risen Lord fill your hearts and restore hope in our country, Nigeria, Amen,” he added.
