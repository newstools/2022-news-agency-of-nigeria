Chairman of Oyo State Sports Council, Gbenga Adewusi, made this known in a statement issued on Wednesday. Adewusi stated that the event, organised by Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, would give Para athletes the opportunity to exhibit their talents in various sports.

Adewusl also said that the country’s Para-sports had produced the highest number of medals for the country since Nigeria started participating in the games. He added that Para-sports had contributed immensely to reduction of young people with special needs roaming the streets.
