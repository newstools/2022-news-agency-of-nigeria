He said that the party had come to restore smiles on the faces of Nigerians by enhancing that the living condition of the average Nigerian is beyond the minimum wage. “And this is the only party that has Nigerians at heart to reduce the current high cost of living because it is a grassroot-based political party by its foundation and structures,” he said.
