By Oluwafunke Ishola Action Health Incorporated (AHI), through its ‘Girls Voices’ programme, has trained 1,200 in-school adolescent girls on equality issues, girls’ rights and adolescent health and wellbeing in Lagos. Co-Founder of AHI, Uwemedimo Esiet, disclosed this during the closing of leadership and mentoring sessions with students of Wesley Girls Junior Secondary School, on Friday in Lagos. Esiet noted that AHI, with the support of CUMMINS, had assisted in training girl-leaders to advance their advocacy through activities that would improve equity and equality issues, girls’ rights, adolescent health and wellbeing of Lagos girls. He said that the girl-leaders had led a mentoring and leadership forum for eight weeks for students in Wesley Girls Junior Secondary School. According to him, the forum serves as a platform to influence the girls on life skills and social networks as well as menstrual hygiene management. Esiet noted that the skills acquired had enhanced the girls’ self-awareness, negotiation, goal-setting, decision-making and leadership capacity. “Some of the girls are eager to start implementing what they had learnt. Some even want to create girls’ clubs in their churches, mosques and schools. “The platform has exposed the capacity of the girls to become leaders and change agents in their respective communities,” he said. According to him, positive outcomes have been achieved from the projects, assuring that the influence of the girls on their peers will lead to a transformed society. Also, Principal of the school, Mrs Olaitan Fasuyi, commended AHI and CUMMINS for the support given to the students. Fasuyi expressed optimism that the students would begin to manifest the skills they had acquired for the transformation of the society. (NAN)
