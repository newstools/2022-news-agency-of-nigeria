By Lizzy Okoji A South-East women group under the aegis of Igbo Women Forum has pledged its support to Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi for President in 2023, assuring him of 25 million votes. President of the Group, Uju Obi, made the pledge in a statement on Monday, stating that the group was set to hold a massive rally for Bello in Abuja. Obi said that the group had decided to throw its weight around Bello based on his qualities and achievements in Kogi, which the  members believed “is  the key to Nigeria’s transformation”. “Unlike other aspirants, Alhaji Bello has shown the capacity to quell the rising tide of terrorism, kidnapping and other criminal vices across the nation. “Amongst other qualities, Governor Bello possesses is his priority for the nation’s unity and security. “Another trait that stands out about the Kogi governor is his national appeal as he is loved by most Nigerians – irrespective of religion, tribe and ethnicity. “This is not surprising, as the governor has carried everyone along in his government, not minding the usual sentiments,” Obi said. Obi stated that in spite of being a devout Muslim, Christians flocked the governor and part of his virtue on religious tolerance could be seen in his building of a chapel inside the Government House. “At 46, Bello would represent a paradigm shift from the era of old rulers. “Bello is not just a youth; he has proven his mettle at the highest level and will need little time to hit the ground running,” she said The Igbo women, however, urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to forfeit the mooted idea of zoning its presidential ticket to the south. Obi said that the idea was to push for capabilities rather than sentiments; hence a President must not just be imposed on the people just to meet the zoning demand. The group also vowed to prevail on all the Igbo contestants, especially the delegates, to shun ethnic sentiment and support the best man for the job. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
