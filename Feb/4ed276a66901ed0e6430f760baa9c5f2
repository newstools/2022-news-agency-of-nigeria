The State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, told newsmen in Asaba that it was part of the decisions reached at a recent State Executive Council (EXCO). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration had three years ago engaged about 1,000 science teachers in its secondary schools across the state.

According to him the applicants will be tested on their areas of study.
