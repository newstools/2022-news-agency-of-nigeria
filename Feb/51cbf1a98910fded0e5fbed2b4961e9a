The 19 northern States and FCT Youth wing of the Christians Association of Nigerian (YOWICAN) has honoured the former Zamfara state governor, Sen. Ahmad Yarima. He was awarded the Leadership Merit as a Pillar of Hope and Good governance on Friday in Abuja. It was presented during an interactive session by Yarima with the group as part of his ongoing consultation with various support and religious groups on the 2023 elections.   The Chairman of YOWICAN, Evangelists Musa Misal, said the award was part of their consultations and quest for finding a lasting solution to Nigeria’s religious and sectional challenges. Misal said the leaders of the CAN youth wing in the 19 northern states and Abuja were prepared for the 2023 elections and would only vote someone with vision for harmony across religious lines. “Honourable Senator, we know the role you have played in Zamfara in providing jobs to our fellow christians without discrimination, this shows that you are a good leader. “Many leaders have ruled Nigeria but nothing has changed yet, so we have to try a religious man like you,” Misal said. In his response, Yarima gave the assurance that he would be a rallying point for all Nigerians irrespective of any differences. He noted that part of the problems that Nigeria is facing today was related to the lack of proper tolerance for each other and ignorance. The former governor also said that these are part of the reasons why he wants to be elected as Nigeria’s next president. Yarima stated that the constitution gives everyone the right to his or her religion without interference. “Some people use religion to divide people for their selfish interest. “But we will give everyone a chance. All Christians know the opportunity we gave them when we ruled Zamfara State,” he said.(NAN)
