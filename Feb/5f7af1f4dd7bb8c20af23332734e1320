The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ola donated a set of jersey and footballs to the management for the school team. He made the donation under the auspices of his Sunday Ola Foundation on Wednesday. Making the donation, the Coordinator of the foundation, Mr Abiodun Adamolekun, said the gesture was Ola’s modest way of giving back to his Alma Mater. Adamolekun also said the items were meant to give the school football team “a brand new and befitting look during matches with other schools”. He described the gifts as the beginning of more initiatives of the foundation and promised that the gesture would soon be extended to other schools in the state. He encouraged the students to remain focused and always concentrate on their studies, while also striving to do well in sports. He further admonished them to shun social vices, such as rituals, hooliganism, cultism and absenteeism, and to endeavour to be responsible children in society. The National President of the school’s alumni association, Prof. Omotayo Fagbuaro, who attended the presentation, thanked the donor for his kind gesture. Fagbuaro said the gesture was in line with the association’s “vision of giving back to the development of the Alma Mater”.
