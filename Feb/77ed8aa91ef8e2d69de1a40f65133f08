By Deborah Coker A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chief Dan Orbih, has charged politicians to play by the rules now that the Amended Electoral Act has been signed into law. Orbih, National Vice-Chairman, PDP South-South, said in Benin on Sunday that it was the political actors that would determine whether or not the Act would impact on the 2023 general elections. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that “there is no Constitution that is totally bad. “It is the operators that can be bad. The same applies to the Electoral Act when you think about it positively or negatively. “What is important actually is the politicians; the political actors. They must learn to play by the rules.’’ The PDP stalwart stressed that it was not what was in the Act that would determine the behaviour of people. “We have a whole lot that must be done by political actors themselves. “They must learn to take defeat in good faith. They must allow the process to take its course. Nobody should make any attempt to interfere with due process in the conduct of the elections,’’ he said. The PDP leader added that apart from signing the Electoral Act into law, the president should ensure adequate security of lives and property during and after elections. Orbih also told NAN that the president must ensure that elections are conducted under very peaceful and secure atmosphere and equally ensure continuous improvement in the economy. President Muhammadu Buhari signed the amended Electoral Act into law on Feb. 25. (NAN)
