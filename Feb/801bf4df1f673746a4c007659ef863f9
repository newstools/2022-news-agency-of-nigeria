By Aisha Gambo A business woman, Khadija Muhammad on Wednesday dragged her husband, Umar Abdullahi to a Shari’a court sitting at Rigasa, Kaduna for allegedly refusing to acknowledge their union. She told the court that she was married to the defendant but later travelled to Saudi Arabia, praying court to assist her to confirm the position of her marriage. The complainant also told the court that the defendant had collected goods worth N194, 300 from her since 2017 but failed to pay her. She prayed the court to assist her to recover the money. In his defense, the defendant denied getting married to Muhammad, saying they only courted for a while but had not tied the knot. He agreed to the amount the complainant claimed he owed and told the court that he intended to pay. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the court had earlier invited witnesses to testify on the marital relationship of the duo. All the witnesses presented could not state clearly whether the two parties were married. They all said they knew about the ex-couple’s courtship, not marriage. The Judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta adjourned the case to March 9 for a ruling. (NAN)
