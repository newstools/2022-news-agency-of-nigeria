By Stephen Adeleye Lokoja, Feb. 4, 2022 (NAN) The Kogi State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr. Wemi Jones, on Friday said the state government had declared a state of emergency on the education sector in the state. Jones disclosed this on Friday during the Educational Task Force Meeting with Some Critical Educational Stakeholders in Kogi Central Senatorial District, at Government Day Secondary School (GDSS), Iruvucheba, Okene Local Governnent Area of the state. He expressed optimism that the move by Gov. Yahaya Bello, had brought innovations and remodelling of secondary schools in the state, with a view to making the state regain its lost glory in education. He noted that with the state having two universities, there was a dare need to adequately prepare students in secondary schools to fit into the vision of the governor for quality assurance and become self-reliant. Jones described education as the only guarantee for the future, noting that the emergency declaration had also manifested in several ongoing renovation and rehabilitation projects in the district to reposition education in the state. He emphasised the need for the state to move in the direction of Science, Technology, English and Mathematics, for it not to “be left behind in the new wave of educational development, hence the declaration of a state of emergency on the sector.” He said the state government was conscious of the shortfall of teachers in secondary schools and making efforts to fill the vacancies occasioned by retirements, transfers and the civil service reforms. Jones, however, solicited the support of stakeholders for the success of the adoption and mentorship programme, saying that the state government could not do it alone.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
