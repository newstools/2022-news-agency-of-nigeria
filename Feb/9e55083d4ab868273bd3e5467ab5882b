By Sumaila Ogbaje North-East Women for Peace, a non-partisan group, has commended the Nigeria Armed Forces for the sustained raid on Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in the region. The group gave the commendation in a statement by its Coordinator, Mrs Fatima Bindir, on Monday in Abuja. Bindir said the renewed synergy between the three services of the armed forces had proven to be effective in the war against insurgency in the North East. She commended the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, for ensuring that the armed forces under his command continued to mount pressure on the terrorists. According to her, the surrender of the terrorists and their families in different location within the theater of operations show that they are under intense attack by troops. “We commend the Defence Headquarters for the coordination which has continued to yield results in the war against insurgency. “We urge our people, especially our women to support and cooperate with the armed forces to restore peace in our region because, without peace, there will be no development,” she said. The group said that the recent surrender of 104 ISWAP terrorists and their families in Damboa area of Borno was a reflection of pressure by the troops of the armed forces. (NAN)
