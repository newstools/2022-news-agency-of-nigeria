By Naomi Sharang Niger Delta Indigenous Contractors Association on Thursday said its members were poised for a nationwide protest over non-payment of their outstanding debts. The contractors issued a five-day ultimatum to the Interim Administrator of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Mr Akwa Effiong, and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio, to pay outstanding debts. Spokesman of the association, Mr Dressman Darlinton, told a news conference in Abuja that if the duo failed to accede to their demands, a nationwide protest would begin next week. “The association will protest in the Niger Delta region and the FCT should the interim administrator of the NDDC fail to meet our demand to pay contractors by Tuesday, Feb. 15,” he said. Darlinton called on President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a substantive board for the commission as soon as possible to prevent the mismanagement of the commission. “The association wants the president to consider the request of the Olu of Warri and other prominent Niger Delta stakeholders to, as matter of urgency, constitute and inaugurate a substantive board of the NDDC,” he stressed.
