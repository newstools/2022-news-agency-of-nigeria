By Salisu Sani-Idris Mr Christopher Zakka, the newly elected Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring free and fair election in the FCT. Zakka, who gave the commendation at a news conference on Tuesday in Abuja, also lauded the security agencies for ensuring a peaceful conduct of chairmanship and councillorship election in the Territory. He also thanked the FCT residents for giving him the mandate to pilot the affairs of the council for the next three years. Zakka said that his administration would give priority to projects such as rural water supply, electricity, education, roads, health and other developmental programmes that would improve the well-being of the people. He, however, solicited the support of residents to enable him to succeed in his developmental programmes. The chairman-elect appealed to Buhari to sign into law the amendment electoral Bill before him, noting that the call had become necessary to ensure a free, fair and credible general elections in 2023. He noted that the current generation of Nigerians, most especially the youth, requires an electoral law that could stand the test of time in the area of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Zakka explained that electronic transmission of result, which was included in the newly amended electoral Bill by the National Assembly, would give credence to the 2023 general elections. “The manual collation of results in the past has resulted to rigging in so many ways, therefore, the introduction of electronic transmission of results is a welcome development,’’ he said. He, therefore, advised Nigerians to support the new electoral amendment bill passed by both chambers of the National Assembly for the overall development of the country. (NAN)
