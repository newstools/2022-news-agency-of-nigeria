By Shedrack Frank The Director-General of the Bayelsa Governor’s Cup, Mr Ono Akpe, says that FIFA-licensed international agents will attend the tournament to scout for talents. Akpe said this on Wednesday in Yenagoa while unveiling the tournament, tagged: “Prosperity Cup”. He said that over the years, the competition had produced professional footballers playing in different clubs across the world. He said that aside from helping to showcase football talents in the state, the tournament would also bring peace, unity and togetherness among the youths.

He further said the governor would take the kick-off at the Sampson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa. He said that the tournament would hold in two centres in each of the eight local government areas of the state. Akpe said that the tournament would be limited to U-20 players and solicited the support of well-placed individuals and corporate organisations for a successful event. He said that those who emerged first, second, third and fourth positions would go home with money prizes. (NAN)
