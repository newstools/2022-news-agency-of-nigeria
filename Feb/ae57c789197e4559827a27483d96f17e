By Emmanuel Afonne A frontline human rights activist, Idris Usman, has announced his resignation as the Executive Director of Sustainable Initiative for Nurturing Growth (SING), Nigeria. SING Nigeria is a non-governmental organisation based in the nation’s capital that works in thematic areas of good governance, human capital development and climate justice. Usman said in a statement issued on Monday that his resignation was necessitated by his new found interest and engagement which he said might clash with his position in the organisation. He served as the Executive Director of the organisation for four years. “I am constrained to announce that I will be stepping aside from my duties as Executive Director/CEO of SING Nigeria, to enable me focus on other interests and engagements. “In doing this, I am not in any way shrinking back from my enormous responsibilities to SING and its many stakeholders, but this step is needed to avoid a clash of interests between SING and my other engagements. “I take this step knowing that the team will continue to pursue our set objectives and expand SING’s impact across its thematic areas and beyond,” the statement quoted Usman as saying.
