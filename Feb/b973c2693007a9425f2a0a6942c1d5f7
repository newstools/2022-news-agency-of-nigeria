Babangida gave the advice on Tuesday, when he received a Presidential Aspirant, Prince Adewole Adebayo, who paid him a consultation visit at his Minna hilltop residence. Adebayo, the founder of Kaftan Television, speaking with newsmen after his meeting with Babangida, said the former president advised him not to negotiate the unity of the country. The aspirant, under Third-force, said he was in Minna to seek the support, blessings, prayers and advice of Babangida on his quest to contest 2023 presidential election. Adebayo said that the former president stressed the need to make each election in Nigeria better than any of the previous to deepen the country’s democracy for glorious future. “Former president Babangida believed that we should not negotiate the unity of this country irrespective of any challenges we are facing. “He also advised me that if I must succeed as president of Nigeria I must practice a mini Nigeria every time, even in my house. “He said that even in your domestic, when someone looks around he must see a mini Nigeria setting there. “He added that even in your thinking, when you are alone, you must think holistically, not a sector of it. That you must take advice from all parts of the country,” Adebayo said. The presidential aspirant also said that Babangida stressed the role of Nigerians in Diaspora in the development of the country, recalling why he involved them in his administration. According to Adebayo, the former president stressed the role of prayers and the need to think ahead, saying “you need to work very hard because Nigeria has many talented people and if you want to be number one, you must go extra mile.” He commended the fatherly role Banagida played in his life for many  years, adding that the visit was critical given his eight years experience as president and his contributions to the development of Nigeria. “He has served in the office of the president for eight years,” adding that he laid many foundations for the country, created Abuja, the capital city and many others.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
