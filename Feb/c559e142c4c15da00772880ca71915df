ASUU, on Friday, expressed doubts over the ability of the Federal Government to resolve the lingering crisis in the education sector, particularly the universities, threatening that the union might soon commence an indefinite strike. However, the President stated that no society which wished itself well neglected its educational system and all its component parts. He, therefore, commended the leadership of NIREC for intervening in the year-long strike by ASUU and holding consultations with the parties.
