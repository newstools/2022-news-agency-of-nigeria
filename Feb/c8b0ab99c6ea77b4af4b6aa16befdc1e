By Gami Tadanyigbe Mr Amido Sarki, the All Progressives Congress (APC), Kuje Chairmanship candidate in Saturday’s FCT Area Councils Poll, has expressed dissatisfaction over lack of enough polling units in his voting centre in Gaube, Kuje. Sarki said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Kuje. He also expressed dissatisfaction over the malfunctioning of INEC Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). He said the voting centre with over 1000 accredited voters has only one voting point, thereby making the exercise very slow and frustrating for the electorate. According to him, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should not have introduced the BVAs in the area councils election without proper testing and verification. “If the challenge is not properly addressed, people may not have the opportunity to cast their votes in good time. “I advise INEC to also ensure that everyone in the queue should be allowed to vote before they stop the exercise. “INEC should have spilt the unit into smaller units to facilitate the process, where more machine can be made available,” he said. NAN reports that only a few voters had cast their votes at polling unit 003 and unit 004 at Kayarda Primary school voting centre at the time of filing this report. (NAN)
