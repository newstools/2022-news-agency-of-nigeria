By Abdullahi Shugaba The Small and Medium Development Agency (SMEDAN) of Nigeria has adopted “One Local Government, One Product” (OLOP) programme on agric -value chain with a view to develop the country’s economy. Dr Dikko Radda, Director-General (DG) of the Agency stated this at the official signing of Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with Microfinance Banks and Candidate-Beneficiaries under the Programme in Katsina on Monday. Radda said that OLOP was adopted by SMEDAN for promoting the development of at least one identified agric-value product per local government area in the country. He said that the aim was to add value to the identified raw material for branding and be certified for import and export. According to him, the main objective of OLOP is to upgrade human capacity through technological and financial support for efficient and viable cooperative enterprises. “This will improve productivity and quality of our products to achieve competitiveness to meet national and international standards. “I am glad to inform you that the Agency will be supporting 199 cooperative/enterprises in 199 local government areas under the OLOP 2021/2022 intervention. “Some 364 of the 774 LGAs in the country have benefitted from the scheme from the 2016 to 2020 intervention. “About 212 LGAs were covered in 2021 under our estimation, leaving a balance of 198 to be covered in 2022,” he added. The DG noted that President Muhammad Buhari was committed to fighting unemployment through the development of agriculture and its value chain products. He commended the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, for his unflinching support towards the growth of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the state.
