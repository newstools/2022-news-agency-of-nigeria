The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the logistics corps are: Nigerian Army Medical Corps (NAMC), Nigerian Army Corps of Supply and Transport (NACST) and Nigerian Army Ordnance Corps (NAOC). Others are the Nigerian Army Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (NACEME) and the Nigerian Army College of Logistics (NACOL). Col. Idris Solebo, the Ag Commander, NAMC, said this during the joint NA Logistics Corps West African Social Activities 2021(WASA) on Saturday at 9 Brigade Garrison Ikeja, Lagos. Solubo said that the logistics corps contributed immensely to the overall successes recorded by the NA in 2021. “All the logistics corps was able to provide effective and efficient logistics support to all NA training exercises and operations as well as capacity development of officers in NACOL. “The logistics corps is currently providing robust logistics enablement in support of ‘Ex HADIN KAI’ and ‘Ex HADARIN DAJI’ in the north east and north west of the country respectively. “We have also contributed resources and supported NA exercises with men, material and equipment like providing combat service support for ‘Ex GOLDEN DAWN’, ‘Ex STILL WATER’ and ‘Ex CROCODILE SMILE VI’ among others,” he added. The colonel said that the successes recorded in 2021 would further spur the logistics corps to re-double its effort for better logistics support to all NA activities in the years ahead. “This is a testament to the Chief of Army Staff’s (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya’s vision which is: “A Professional Nigerian Army Ready to Accomplish Assigned Missions Within a Joint Environment in Defense of Nigeria.” Solubo enjoined military personnel to remain dedicated and committed in the discharge of their collective responsibilities of ensuring peace and stability across the country as the year commenced. “For us to consolidate on the achievements recorded so far, we must remain focused, dedicated and resilient in the discharge of our duties. “Diligence and loyalty will be constantly rewarded while any act of indiscipline will receive appropriate sanctions as discipline is the bedrock of the military and its successes,” he said. The colonel thanked the COAS for his laudable efforts in strengthening the NA through purposeful and visionary leadership. The Special Guest of Honour, Mr Bashir Jamoh, Director General Nigerian Maritime and Safety Agency (NIMASA), congratulated the NA for organising such social activities that promoted peace and unity among soldiers. Jamoh was represented by Mr Bature Jonathan, Head of Security, NIMASA. He said that such activities would boost the morale of officers and encourage them to put in more efforts in the discharge of their duties. NAN reports that 10 officers were rewarded for their excellent service to the country. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
