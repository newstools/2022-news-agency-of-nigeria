By Yakubu Uba Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno has sought for the support of the UN agencies for the ongoing rehabilitation and resettlement programme of the state government Zulum made call on Wednesday while recieving the Acting UN Resident and Hummanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Mr Mathias Schmake who led a UN delegation on a courtesy call on the governor in Maiduguri. “There are over 50,000 resettled farmers that returned to their recovered communities who are in need of support to pick up thier lives once again. “We also need humanitarian support for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in many camps outside Maiduguri, “We want your help in medium and long term sustainable solutions. Let’s work together in addressing grey areas and avoid duplication of some programmes,” Zulum said. The governor who denied reports of IDPs being forced to vacate camps in Maiduguri, said that all  resettlement was done inline with Kampala Convention. He pointed out that with the gradual return of peace, many displaced persons staying in Maiduguri camps and neighbouring countries were desperate to return to thier ancestral homes. He said that his administration has already set up a committee to monitor progress of resettled communities with a view to addressing challenges that might crop up. Earlier, Schmake said they were in Borno for familiarisation visit and see how to build on the successes recorded in addressing the humanitarian situation in the state. Schmake said UN would continue to complement government effort in achieving what is best for the people, particularly in overcoming dependency on aides.
