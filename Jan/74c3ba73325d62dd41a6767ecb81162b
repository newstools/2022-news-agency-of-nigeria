By Ijeoma Olorunfemi The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has invited Persons Living With Disabilities (PLWDs) from the South-South for a five-day training on digital skills and entrepreneurship. This is contained in a statement by the agency’s Corporate Affairs and External Relations Head, Mrs Hadiza Umar, on Wednesday in Abuja. Umar said the training was in line with the actualisation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) mandate of attaining 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030. She said the programme was the combination of execution of two initiatives from the seven NITDA’s Strategic RoadMap and Action Plan (SRAP) 2021-2024 – Digital Transformation, and Digital Literacy and Skills. “Digital transformation enables the facilitation of digital inclusion programmes for PLWDs and other digitally excluded people aimed at increasing the level of digitisation and digitalisation across both public and private sectors. “Digital literacy and skills is focused on massive training of Nigerians from all works of life to increase the rate of digital literacy and skills among Nigerians and create a pool of global competitive human capital towards the drive of digital transformation in the public and private sector. “The two pillars promote the creation of capacity building schemes for digital entrepreneurship,’’ she said. According to her, the capacity building programme will take place in Port Harcourt. “Interested participants should indicate by filling the application form on http://plwd.nitda.gov.ng, beginning from 10 a.m. on Tuesday January 11, 2022, and close by midnight of Tuesday 18th January 2022,’’ Umar advised.
