By Deborah Coker The Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police, Zone 5, Lawan Jimeta, on Tuesday tasked newly promoted officers in the zone on professionalism and commitment to efficient and effective policing. Jimeta gave the charge in Benin, while decorating the three newly promoted officers serving at the headquarters of the zone comprising Edo and Delta. He also charged the newly elevated officers to see their promotion as the work of God as “promotion comes from above.” The AIG reminded them that they must remain professional, committed and dedicated as promotion came with additional responsibilities and challenges. He congratulated them and prayed God to grant them wisdom to shoulder the responsibilities of their new ranks. Jemeta also appreciated the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba, and the Police Service Commission for the recommendation and subsequent promotion of the officers. According to him, the promotion will go a long way in boosting the morale of the officers and enhance their productivity. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the officers decorated with their new ranks included DCP Charles Dike. Dike, until now, was the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Zonal Criminal Investigations Department, Zone 5 Headquarters, Benin. Others promoted were CSP Oweikpo Pere, the Zonal Provost Marshal as well as SP Blessing Evbakhavbokun, the 2IC, General Investigation, Zonal CID, Benin. Responding on behalf of the promoted officers, Dike thanked God Almighty for considering them worthy of elevation to their next ranks. He also thanked the AIG for finding out time to personally decorate them, and promised to work harder, in line with professional ethics and constitutional provisions to justify the confidence reposed in them.
