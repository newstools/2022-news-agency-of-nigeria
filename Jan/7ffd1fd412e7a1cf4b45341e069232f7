By Muhyideen Jimoh Nigeria’s High Commissioner to Cameroon, Amb. Abayomi Olonisakin has assured Nigerians of stronger collaboration between Nigeria and Cameroon to tackle insecurity, especially along the corridors of both countries. Olonisakin told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Garoua, Cameroon on Saturday that deepening bilateral relations and welfare of Nigerians in Cameroon had been his priority since he assumed duty in 2021. “I want to firstly say the relationship between Nigeria and Cameroon has been cordial. “We are like brothers and that has also played out in all areas,” he said. The envoy said both countries were exploring more ways of tackling the insurgency and general insecurity along their common borders. “On security, I can assure you that both Nigeria and Cameroon have been working on bilateral and multilateral levels. “This of course involves the multinational joint task force which is under the Lake Chad Basin Commission. “These two approaches have really assisted in addressing the security issues in the far Lake Chad region. “So, we will continue to enhance and support these initiatives so that we could get done with the job (tackling insecurity),” he said Olonisakin told NAN that he had embarked on a tour of Cameroon to meet with Nigerian communities with a view to ensuring their welfare and resolving pending issues “Since I assumed duty here (last year) I have gone round to meet with Nigerian communities to see and hear where they have issues. “We’ve been able to step it up to a level that we can resolve it with the government and of course, there has been various commissions, committees that have been working like the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission,” he added. NAN reports that Olonisakin, a former Chief of Defence Staff, who hails from Ekiti was appointed Nigeria’s High Commissioner to Cameroon in June, 2021.
