By Deborah Coker The 4 Brigade, Nigerian Army, has pledged its commitment to improving discipline and sustained training to meet the army’s constitutional role. Brig.-Gen Sani Abdullahi made the pledge on Thursday in Benin in his opening remarks at the 2021 Nigerian Army Social Activities (NASA) organised by the brigade. He said that NASA which, he described, as an aged long military tradition was aimed at creating a social and conducive atmosphere for officers, soldiers and families to socialise with their host communities at the end of the training year. He also disclosed that the origin of NASA could be traced to the Second World War when the Nigerian Army fought as part of the larger West Africa Frontier Force of the British Army. Abdullahi noted that in contemporary times NASA had also become an avenue where formations and units showcased their achievements. He disclosed that the year 2022 had started with enthusiasm and high hopes of further actualisation of the Chief of Army Staff’s vision of consolidating on the gains of the past year. He said the brigade had been able to achieve its training objectives for the 2021 training year which was to improve professionalism and sustain regimentation. Abdullahi added that this was made possible by the zeal and determination of officers and soldiers of the brigade. He commended the General Officer Commanding 2 Division for his commitment to actualisation of the 4 Brigade 2021 training mandate and the welfare of its personnel. He pledged the brigade’s unalloyed loyalty to the country and the leadership of the Nigerian Army. He also commended sister security agencies and all paramilitary establishments for their contributions especially during the conduct of “Exercise Still Waters“. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 4 Brigade NASA featured colourful and entertaining dances, tug of war, and inspection of local dishes from different parts of the country as presented by various units and sub units.
