By Ismaila Chafe President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed regret for not visiting Zamfara as earlier planned on Thursday, due to inclement weather conditions. The President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in a statement, said Buhari made his feelings known in a special broadcast to the people of Zamfara on Thursday evening. The President said: ”It pains me that I can no longer be with you today as I had planned. I had just finished what I came to do in Sokoto at the BUA cement facility and was looking forward to meeting you. ”I have been told that the trip cannot hold anymore because of bad weather which has made it impossible for my helicopter to fly to Gusau from Sokoto. “I understand how you feel about this development but I know that you will agree with me that Allah knows best. ”I particularly sympathise with your Governor, Bello Matawalle and his cabinet who have put everything in place to make the visit a successful one. ”I look forward to a more weather-friendly period when I will visit.” The President reiterated his administration’s determination to put an end to the activities of bandits and terrorists in the state, and directed security agencies to sustain the onslaught against the criminal elements. He reassured that the Federal Government in collaboration with the Zamfara  government would continue to ensure peace and stability in the state. ”I am directing our security agencies to sustain the onslaught against terrorists, restrict cross-boundary infiltration and all unauthorised access to the goldmines in the state. ”The Federal Government and the Zamfara government are working to ensure that peace returns to all parts of the state in the shortest possible time and we expect all citizens to cooperate with, and support in all ways, the Armed Forces and other security agencies. ”God bless the people of Zamfara,” he said.
