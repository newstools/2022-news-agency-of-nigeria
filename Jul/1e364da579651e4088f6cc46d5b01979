Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje   By Bosede Olufunmi Kano State government has restricted the movement of commercial tricycle operators, called Keke NAPEP, after 10:00 p.m with effective from Thursday, July 21. This is contained in a statement issued by Nabilusi Abubakar, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of Kano Road and Traffic Agency (KAROTA), on behalf of the Managing Director of the agency, Hon. Baffa Babba-Dan’agundi in Kano on Thursday. According to the statement, Babba-Dan’agundi, said that arrangements had been made for alternative means of transportation during the affected hours for those on special duties and other travellers. The MD, however, warned operators on strict compliance with the laid down traffic rules and regulations. According to the statement, this is coming after the leadership of transport unions had reached an agreement with the state government to effect the decision on the ban until further notice to curb security challenges. “This decision was unanimously adopted at a security council meeting, where it became necessary to further safeguard the state from turning to security threats. “Anyone who violates the order without justification shall be prosecuted accordingly,” the statement said. Earlier, Ashiru Umar, the State Chairman, Kano Transportation Union, was at the agency’s headquarters to express the readiness to abide by the state government’s directive. He lauded the decision to provide alternatives during the affected hours to ensure that those on special duties, travellers, patients and others on emergency without personal means of transportation get to their destinations. He urged the general public to accord the union every necessary support for the safety of lives and property. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)   Edited by Ayodeji Alabi/Julius Toba-Jegede
