The Nigeria Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC) says it will continue to use pilgrimage to foster unity and promote moral transformation in the country. The Executive Secretary, Rev. Yakubu Pam, made the pledge at the celebration of his second year in office on Thursday, in Abuja. He said that in spite of the challenges of the Coronavirus  (COVID-19) pandemic, the commission was able to conduct successful pilgrimages to some holy sites across the world. “ I want to first and foremost thank the Almighty God for this appointment and as well appreciate Mr. President for finding me worthy and deserving to superintend over the affairs of NCPC at a time like this. “ My assumption of office was at the most challenging time because then, the world stood still for the ravaging and most dreaded COVID-19 global pandemic, which destabilized all facets of human endeavour. “Of course, as you all know, the primary mandate of NCPC is to organise, coordinate and superintend over the affairs of Christian Pilgrimage in Nigeria by supervising the movement of Nigerian Christians to the Holy Sites around the world. “But the restrictions placed on international travels by the global pandemic affected the Commission adversely and even our sister agency- the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria so much so that pilgrimage activities were hampered globally,” he said. He said these were the situations he met on ground when he took over the helm of affairs on July 7, 2020, adding that “it is often said that in every adversity there is always an equal opportunity,” he said. He said the predicament posed by the COVID-19 pandemic compelled the commission to think outside the box by exploring new alternatives for its pilgrimage activities. He said that as Israel borders were shut down against international pilgrims, the commission through its enabling Act explored other Holy Sites around the world in 2021. He said that the commission discovered Jordan and eventual prosecuted its maiden pilgrimage to the Kingdom of Jordan between July 24, 2021 and September, 2021. “ Today, we can safely say that the NCPC maiden pilgrimage to Jordan was no doubt a big success and has been adjudged one of the finest outings of the commission in the last decade as no single abscondment was recorded. “ By this fact, the commission has officially incorporated Jordan as a new pilgrimage destination  and will continue to explore more Holy Sites in the world so as to provide alternatives for Nigerian Pilgrims,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-281957" src="https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0018-300x225.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0018-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0018-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0018.jpg 1024w" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> He said the commission had talks with Turkey in January, and visited some of their holy sites, with a plan to include them in its pilgrimage programme in the nearest future. “It is therefore interesting to note that with two years of being in the saddle, the commission has been able to carry out its maiden pilgrimage exercise to the Kingdom of Jordan. “And, the 2021 Main/Easter pilgrimage 2022 exercise to Israel and Jordan on June 15, 2022 and will be rounding off in August this year,’’ he said. He commended the Federal Government for approving the construction of the Pilgrims Heritage Camp House situated at the high brawl Central Business District, Abuja. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-281954" src="https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0019-300x225.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0019-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0019-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.portal.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220707-WA0019.jpg 1024w" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> He also lauded the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the media, state governors and strategic partners such as the Ground Handlers and the Air Carriers for their support to the commission in the last two years. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the commission unveiled the fifth edition of the Nigerian Pilgrim Magazine and the cutting of the anniversary cake.
