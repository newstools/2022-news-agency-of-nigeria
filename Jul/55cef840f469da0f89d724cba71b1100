By Taiye Agbaje The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), on Sunday, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replicate the successes it recorded in Ekiti State and Osun governorship polls in the 2023 general elections. CDD, through its Election Analysis Centre (EAC) also commended INEC and other election stakeholders for the successful conduct of the Saturday’s governorship election in Osun. In its post-election statement signed by its Director, Idayat Hassan and the CDD-EAC Chairman, Prof. Adele Jinadu, the group praised all election stakeholders for what it described as a positive performance. It expressed satisfaction that despite apprehension about the possibility of violent disruption of the election, the process turned out to be peaceful. “As Nigeria marches towards the 2023 general elections therefore, CDD-EAC reiterated its call to INEC and stakeholders to maintain and consolidate their cordial working relationship for the conduct of future elections. “The collaboration between INEC and other stakeholders, especially civil society organisations (CSOs) and security agents, including anti-graft agencies such as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC) also contributed to the successful outcome of the Osun election. With the countdown towards the highly anticipated 2023 general elections, all stakeholders must sustain the synergies, which have contributed to the vast improvements recorded in Osun and Ekiti States. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49927" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/images-6.jpeg" alt="" width="220" height="145" /> “At the CDD-EAC, we hope to see the improvements recorded in the recent elections replicated in the conduct of the 2023 general elections,” the group said.
