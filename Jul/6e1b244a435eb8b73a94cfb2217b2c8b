By Patience Omoha A business group, 2050 Multipurpose Cooperative Limited, on Thursday, unveiled a business carnival and summit in Abuja. Mr Joseph Obaji, the leader of the group, who addressed newsmen, while unveiling the carnival and summit, urged all business owners to participate in the carnival and grow their businesses. He described the carnival as a one-stop market with focus on small and medium scale businesses. The group’s Head of Marketing, Mr Simon Peter, noted that small and medium business owners contributed to about 17 per cent of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product. He added that such a category of business owners needed to be empowered, stressing that they were the drivers of the nation’s economy. Peter further explained that the carnival would also create a platform for business owners to network and grow their businesses. According to him, they would be exposed to seminars, where professionals would talk to them about the challenges which they were faced with, as well as proffer solutions to them. He, therefore, called on business owners to cease the opportunity to participate and grow their businesses. Shehu Abdulkadri, a businessman and chief executive officer, Abuja Enterprises Agency Ltd, expressed optimism that the event would provide the best avenue to celebrate business excellence in the FCT. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the carnival proper will take place between Aug. 17 and Aug. 20 at the Velodrome, Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.
