By Salisu Sani-Idris The Speaker, Northern Youths Assembly of Nigeria(NYAN), Malam Mohammed Lawal, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to eliminate the raving menace of banditry and kidnappings in the north. Lawal, in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, also emphasised the need for the northern governors to evolve new strategy to rid the region of all forms of criminality. He said it was very imperative for the President and northern governors to eliminate banditry in the north before “banditry eliminates the region. “Northern Nigeria was a relatively peaceful place with pictures of our leaders and forefathers sitting outside on their mats with their family and kinsmen. “That blissful memory is fast fading away and the cries of banditry, terrorism, cattle rustling, farmer and herder clashes are staring us right in the face. “Our farmers now pay protection taxes to bandits. Our sisters are kidnapped, raped for days and returned. “We cannot keep quiet and pretend that all is well. The north is being engulfed,” he said. The youth leader, however, expressed confidence in the ability and capability of Buhari to tackle the ugly situation in no distance time. “This is because we believe President Buhari has the best intention for the country, but intentions are clearly not good enough.” (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Olawunmi Ashafa
