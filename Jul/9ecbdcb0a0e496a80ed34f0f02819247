Pilgrims are expected to use the day for prayers for themselves, families, friends, the Muslim community as well as their countries.  The Hill of Arafat is also known as Jabal ar-Rahmah, meaning Mountain of Mercy.  On the ninth day of hajj, pilgrims leave Mina for Mount Arafat where they stand in contemplative vigil and pray and recite the Quran. It is here that Prophet Muhammad gave his last sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-49166" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/68432973-EDE6-4E5E-8CED-5C6252302B67-scaled.jpeg 837w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> A pilgrim’s Hajj is considered invalid if they do not spend the afternoon on Mount Arafat. The hajj, usually one of the world’s largest annual religious activities, is prescribed for all Muslims to perform at least once in a life time.  This year no fewer than 42,000 Nigerian pilgrims from states and private tour operators are participating in the religious exercise.(NAN) edited by Sadiya Hamza
