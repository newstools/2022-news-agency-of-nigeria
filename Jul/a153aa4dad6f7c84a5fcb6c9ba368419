The Convener of the group, Prince Koyoyo Uhrorho, gave the charge on Tuesday at the Unveiling/Inauguration of Tinubu Youth Disciples (TYD) in Abuja. Uhrorho said, “ At this critical stage in our country, Nigeria, the sentiments that have divided and held us down as a country should be abandoned and put aside to build a better nation. “By divine mandate, we were born Nigerians by tribe and nationality before religion was introduced, it is therefore awkward to promote the issue of religion to the detriment of our great nation. “On the Muslim/Muslim ticket of Tinubu/Shettima, it is our take that what this country needs at this crucial time is competence and the ability to deliver. “The problem bedeviling us today is not religion, hence the hullabaloo about the Muslim/Muslim Tinubu/Shettima ticket is unnecessary politicised and misplaced.’’ He said that the group, having carefully studied and analysed the antecedents, track records, developmental stride and youth-oriented governance of Tinubu had decided to support his presidential candidacy for 2023. According to him, the group identifies with the need for the Nigerian youths to stand, galvanise and mobilise fellow youths in support of Tinubu/Shetima mandate come 2023 Uhrorho also dispelled that the notion that Nigerian youths are not in support of Tinubu/Shettima ticket. “It is worthy of note that a great percentage of the Nigerian youths in politics are in the APC and are very ready to support the Tinubu/Shettima mandate. “We hereby reassure Nigerian youths that under Tinubu/Shettima the Nigeria’s dreams would be a reality,’’ he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the TYD is a forum for the Nigerian youths with membership cutting across the country, who share the political ideologies of Tinubu. It was also birthed to actualise the vision of the Nigerian youths to effectively participate in politics. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)   Edited by Julius Toba-Jegede
