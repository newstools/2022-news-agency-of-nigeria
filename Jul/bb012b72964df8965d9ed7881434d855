By Kelechi Ogunleye The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has warned residents in Osun against deliberate attempt to raise false alarm to distract security operatives. NSCDC Public Relations Officer (PRO), Mr Olusola Odumosu, said the warning became imperative following reports from the Corps’ situation room of false reports from some residents on voting disruption at certain polling centers. Odumosu said that investigations from the officers on ground and intelligence agents reported that most of the allegations were false. He said that although it was important for suspected election riggings, vote buying and other criminal activities to be reported to security agencies, it was also important not to give false information. He said that some miscreants could dwell on the opportunity to carry out some mischievous activities. Odumosu reiterated that officers and men of the Corps alongside other security agencies had been deployed personnel to provide adequate security at the 3,763 polling units of the state. He said that security reinforcement had been ensured at some of the reported polling units to investigate and arrest suspects if the need arise. He said senior officers of the corps had embarked on election patrol to other senatorial districts as Deputy Commandant General (DCG) Dauda Mungadi in charge of Operations awaited further information from the district heads. Odumosu said that the DCG had earlier monitored the voting process at various polling units and expressed satisfaction at the efforts of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other agencies ensuring the election was free, fair, safe and credible. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that NSCDC Osun Command had announced its toll-free numbers as: 08060003181, 08032898909 and N-alert number: 080046837467.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Isaac Aregbesola
