By Ali Baba Inuwa Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar was born on Nov. 25 , 1946 to Garba Abubakar and Aisha Kande in Jada village of Adamawa. His only sister died at a young age and that made him the only child of his parents. At a young age, Abubakar lost his father to an accident at a neighboring village in 1957. At the time, Abubakar’s father did not believe in modern education, so he stopped his son from attending the compulsory traditional school. However, when the government discovered Garba Abubakar’s action, he was jailed for few days before his mother-in-law was able to pay for his bail. Afterwards, Abubakar started his primary education at Jada Primary School, Adamawa at the age of eight. Thereafter, in 1960, he proceeded to Adamawa provincial secondary school for his secondary education. He graduated in 1965 and enrolled in Nigerian Police College, Kaduna. Shortly after, he left the college to take on the position of tax official at Regional Ministry of Finance. Also, in 1966, he gained admission into the school of Hygiene, Kano and graduated with a diploma in 1967. In the same year, Abubakar proceeded to Ahmadu Bello University on scholarship. There, he graduated with a diploma in law in 1969 and immediately got employed with Nigeria Customs Service. In 1989, Abubakar was selected to represent his constituency at the constituent assembly, set up to form a new constitution for Nigeria. In September 1990, Abubakar joined the governorship race for the former Gongola state. However, in 1991 before the election could hold, the Federal Government divided Gongola into two – Adamawa and Taraba. Abubakar fell into Adamawa. Although, he won the Social Democratic Party (SDP) primaries in November 1991 but was disqualified from contesting in the election. In 1998, he contested as the governor of Adamawa on Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform and won. However, before his swearing-in, he accepted to be the running mate of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. Abubakar was thereafter sworn in as the Vice-President of Nigeria on May 29, 1999. Since his joining politics, Abubakar has unsuccessfully contested five times for the office of President of Nigeria. He did that in 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. In 1993, he contested the (SDP) presidential primaries losing to late Moshood Abiola and Baba Gana Kingibe.
