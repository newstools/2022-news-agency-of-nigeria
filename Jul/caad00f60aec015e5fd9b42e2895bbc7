Executive Chairman of FCC, Dr Muheeba Dankaka, stated this at the second anniversary of the commission’s fourth board in Abuja on Tuesday. Dankaka further said that the commission was designed to ensure that Nigerians do not feel alienated from the national project, thereby giving them a sense of belonging. According her, the commission is a pivotal institution of great magnitude that is clearly mandated to entrust and strengthen national unity. “We shall continue to pursue this mandate with all the vigours and the constitutional powers bestowed on us. “The commission will continue to bring out deliberate policies to make its own contributions toward promoting peace and unity in the country, especially now that the fragmentation in the polity is at an alarming rate,” she said. The chairman further said that although the leadership came into office at a difficult time, adding, however, that within the short period, it had tried to record modest achievements in spite of all odds. She said that the commission had acquired some project vehicles, with the facelift of its headquarters and other state offices as well as capacity building for members of staff. “Also, that the commission had carried out national sensitisation programmes for our stakeholders in readiness for the second mandate has left much to cheer about. “We have also worked hard to deepen our institutional frameworks,” she added. Dankaka added that operationally, there was a turn around and change of operational committees, adding that the commission had enhanced the monitoring and enforcement of its activities, with zero tolerance for non-compliance. She, therefore, called on ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to abide by its extant circulars on recruitment, as it was an offence to recruit or conduct promotion exercises without recourse to the commission. “The commission is poised for strategic prosecution of any MDA and particularly, any chief executive who disregards our guidelines and laws,” the chairman said. While thanking President Muhammadu Buhari for the support and encouragement, she assured that the commission would strive to make a difference in the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
