Britain Foreign Office on Thursday said it would provide a further 2.5 million euros ($2.96 million) as support package to Ukrainian prosecutors investigating alleged war crimes committed by invading Russia forces. It said the package will include the deployment of mobile justice teams to the scene of potential war crimes, the training of up to 90 judges and forensic evidence gathering and support from British experts in sexual violence in conflict. Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad was due to tell the Ukraine Accountability Conference in The Hague that “in Ukraine there is mounting evidence of atrocities, including of sexual violence, committed by Russian forces. “We are working directly with the Ukrainian prosecutor general to ensure all potential war crimes are fully investigated, and those responsible are held to account,” his planned speech said.  (www.nannews.ng )   Edited by Hadiza Mohammed/Tayo Ikujuni
