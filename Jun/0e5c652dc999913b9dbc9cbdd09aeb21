By Ikenna Osuoha Mr Ebubeagu Ekenulo, an activist, on Friday urged Nigerians to vote credible candidates across the country irrespective of political party affiliations. Ekenulo gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He called on the electorate to de-emphasise party affiliation or religious or ethnic leaning if they truly desired a credible leadership. The activist, who expressed displeasure with the level of insecurity and corruption, said that it was time for Nigerians to put the country on the path of prosperity again. “I advise Nigerians to vote credible candidates irrespective of their political parties. “Vote against corruption and bad governance, vote against insecurity and vote out incompetent leadership,” he said. He reiterated the imperatives of restoring sanity and hope for Nigerians by Nigerians through the ballot box. According to him, a new Nigeria is possible when the electorate reject bad and corrupt candidates even with their monetary inducement.
