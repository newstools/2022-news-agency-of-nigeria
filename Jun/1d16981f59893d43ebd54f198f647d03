Sri Lanka’s Department of Zoology says the Wildlife Ministry has run out of funds to provide daily foods to animals in zoos amid the ongoing economic crisis. The department officials on Thursday said there was a severe shortage of funds due to declining foreign tourists and local visitors. Officials said the money allocated by the government in its yearly budget had also been running out. The wildlife minister said steps would be taken to consult with the treasury to provide financial allocations to feed the animals. Sri Lanka’s Dehiwala Zoological Garden, one of the oldest zoos in Asia has a substantial collection of worldwide animals. Sri Lanka is in one of its worst economic crises due to a foreign exchange shortage, which has led to lack of essentials such as medicines, fuel and foods.
