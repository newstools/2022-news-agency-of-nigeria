By Cecilia Ologunagba The head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Mahamet Annadif has reaffirmed the organisation’s commitment to supporting Nigeria in conducting peaceful elections in 2023. UN Spokesperson, Mr Stéphane Dujarric, told correspondents at a news conference in New York on Monday, that Annadif gave the assurance when he met with the Chairman and members of Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission. According to Dujarric, Annadif is in Nigeria for a two-day visit to meet Nigerian authorities, civil society, the diplomatic community as well as UN staff. “In a Tweet, he said he reiterated the UN’s commitment to supporting the country for the holding of peaceful, credible and transparent elections.’’ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Annadif also visited the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) to discuss how the party would guarantee peaceful and credible 2023 general elections. Annadif, who led an eight-member delegation, was received by the APC National Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, who was represented by the party’s Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari. The UN special representative told the party leaders that the international body was banking on the APC for credible polls. According to him, it is the hope that Nigeria stays in good health and be the locomotive for other regions because if Nigeria sneezes, the entire African sub-region catches cold. “We met this morning with officials of INEC, and we plan to meet with all the key actors in Nigeria with a very simple message. “We would like to see the coming elections going peacefully and accepted in all parts of Nigerians. “With the APC in power, you have a very important role to play. We would like to emphasise that the UN is with you and supporting you.’’ (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by Maureen Atuonwu
