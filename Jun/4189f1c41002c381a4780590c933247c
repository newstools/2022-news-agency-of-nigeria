By Gami Tadanyigbe Women Friendly Initiative (WFI), an NGO, says it is committed to contributing its quarter to end Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and drug abuse among youths in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Chief Executive Officer of the NGO, Dr Francis Eremutha, disclosed this on Thursday at a one-day meeting with school management responders and health officials in Abuja. Eremutha said the initiative was part of the organisation’s response to GBV-funded EU Agents for Citizens-driven Transformation (ACT) programme. He said the meeting created an opportunity for school counsellors, health workers and CSOs to share experiences, challenges, innovations and successes recorded in the course of activities to curb the menace. He encouraged participants at the meeting to take advantage of the GBV and drug abuse response directory developed on the project to enhance collaboration and effective referral linkages. The Programe Manager for WFI, Mrs Rosemary Adejoh-Adaji, lauded the school authorities and partners for efforts toward tackling drug abuse in the country. She said about 150 stakeholders comprising school counsellors, clinic operatives, health club coordinators, student leaders, health workers, and civil society organisations had earlier received GBV and drug abuse prevention and response training. According to her, WFI is currently targeting over 20,000 students through sensitisation campaigns in FCT schools to raise awareness about the menace. Mrs Eunice Madaki, the GBV and Adolescent and Youth Desk Officer for Kuje Area Council, commended WFI for the initiative. She urged the organisation to also intensify efforts at targeting parents in the campaign to achieve an all-inclusive sensitisation.
