Collins Yakubu-Hammer Mr Uzorma Ehikwe, the Founder of Strategic Outreach Support (SOSngo), a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO), says the organisation plans to train 5,000 youths on various skills to enhance their sources of livelihood. Ehikwe announced this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja. He said in preparation to that, the organisation recently held skills acquisition sensitisation programme at the Railway Junction in Kubwa, Abuja. “The programme saw youths from all over Abuja and neighboring Niger and Nasarawa states attending in their numbers. “The youth, majorly graduates and corps members, were attracted by the fact that they would learn skills to enhance their socio-economic wellbeing. “The high rate of unemployment might probably have influenced the high turnout by youths to the SOSngo skill acquisition initiative which seemed to serve as a soft landing for graduates seeking an alternate means of income. “We are now set to train 5,000 youths in various skills, including photography, web development, print and design, welding, aluminum windows installation, roofing etc,” he said. According to Ehikwe, the organisation has already secured spaces in offices and businesses around Abuja for the youth to serve as interns after the training. He added that it shall be in a special partnership with the business owner’s association and the SOSngo.org. He said the project would cost about N1.2 billion to offset, adding that this would be the first time SOSngo would open its doors to public patronage and donors. “However, interested youth can visit www.sosngo.org to register for free and be a beneficiary”.
