By Olukayode Babalola Hon. Ahmed Wadada, a former member of the House of Representatives and prominent member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Nasarawa state, brought Keffi town to a standstill during his defection rally to the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Wadada, along with over 20,000 supporters, commenced the rally on Monday at the Keffi Flyover Bridge in Keffi local government area of the state before moving into Keffi township. NAN reports that the rally caused traffic gridlock for many hours at the ever busy Keffi/Akwanga Federal highway and on major roads in Keffi where Wadada and his teeming supporters passed through. <img src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0047-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-47070" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0047-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0047-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0047.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> In an interview with newsmen, Wadada notified his supporters and other locals of his intention to contest for the Nasarawa West Senatorial District seat at the Senate at the forthcoming general elections in 2023 so as to actualize his dream of giving them impactful representation at the National Assembly. Wadada, who said he was optimistic of victory in the forthcoming general elections, said aside initiating people-oriented legislation in the Senate once elected, he plans to initiate projects that will have direct impact on the lives of the people so as to empower them and change their lives for good. “The kind of projects I have for the people are the same kind of projects I carried out for the people when I was a member of the House of Representatives, which is why they are all in my support. <img src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0044-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-47071" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0044-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0044-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0044.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> “I have added value to human capacity. I represented them very well in the past and helped bring civilization to the people,” he said. He expressed delight over the massive support he received from the locals and added that he feels challenged to do much more for the people of the senatorial district if elected to represent them. “I feel fulfilled and much more challenged because for God to bless me with this level of support, it is imperative for me to do much more than I have done before,” he said. He explained that he left the APC due to what he called the controversy that trailed the recently-conducted Nasarawa West Senatorial District primary election which he described as illegal and undemocratic before he withdrew from the contest. <img src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0045-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-47073" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0045-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0045-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220613-WA0045.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /> NAN reports that Hon.
