By Angela Atabo PoliFIX Incorporated, A government advisory, legislative consulting and lobbying group — PoliFIX Incorporated — says it will help in reducing the level of bureaucratic bottlenecks to improve the ease of doing business in the public service. Group Principal Partner Olubunmi Ayantunji announced this in a statement on Friday  in Abuja. “PoliFIX Incorporated is set to be Nigeria’s foremost government advisory and lobbying company ready to hit the ground running in negotiating for organisations and lobbying stakeholders in government. “The group observed that constant change in government policies and unnecessary bureaucratic bottlenecks have affected starter- ups and organisations in accessing government or influencing policies. “This has necessitated the need for star-tup and organisations in the country to employ and deploy experienced hands in the business. “PoliFIX has come to change the narrative in the processes and modus operandi deployed in lobbying and negotiating on behalf of brands, start-ups and organisations. “This will be done on behalf of prospective clients in matters that concern their organisational goals and mandate,’’ he said. According to Ayantunji, the implementing personnel of the company are experienced professionals from diverse fields. He said that the organisation had directorate and legislative personnel who possessed viable experience of more than a decade in the National Assembly and various agencies of government. “Brands can visit the organisation’s website at www.thepolifix.com for information,‘’ he said.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng) ============= Edited by Maharazu Ahmed/Kayode Olaitan
