They asked where I was going to and I told them I was given permission to visit my sister in Ngoshe. “I finally arrived Gava village in Gwoza, after walking for many hours through the deadly forest under hardship condition. I asked some people to direct me to the home of daughter of Chibok. “After meeting her, I told her of my plans to return home, she told me she had wanted to come with me but her husband has placed her on strict surveillance for attempting to run. I then left her and proceeded toward Ngoshe town. “On my way, I met an old man who promised to help me to escape. But he told me that it won’t be possible in the afternoon untill the sun had set. At about 8:00 p.m., he took me to Ngoshe town and told me to pass the night in the outskirt of the town and proceed the next morning. “When the day broke, I took myself to some soldiers where I was rescued with my baby,” she said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47828" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_0923-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> On her part, Hauwa Joseph said she was forcefully married to Amir Abbah, Commander of Boko Haram (Munzul), at Gazuwa camp who was later killed during an encounter with the troops of the Nigerian Army.
