By Bridget Ikyado The Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission, Rev. Yakubu Pam, has urged Nigerians to desist from hate speech. Pam made the appeal when executive members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja on Tuesday. “The country is in a critical time and we need to be mindful of the things we say. Words are powerful; they can build or destroy a nation,” he said. The executive secretary commended the media for the role it had been playing in nation building and development. “The Nigerian media has played a great role in information dissemination. They have always aired the activities of the commission,” Pam noted. He said that the media had provided Nigerians the platform to speak out. The executive secretary said that the commission would begin the transportation of Christian pilgrims to Jordan on June 15. He said that the inaugural flight would consist of pilgrims from Bayelsa and Federal Capital Territory (FCT), who would depart Nigeria from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. He promised that the commission would work with the NUJ and support the union in every way possible as partners in progress. Earlier, the NUJ National President, Mr Chris Isiguzo, commended the executive secretary for his track record of selfless service and integrity. “It is on record that your honesty and hard work have contributed in restoring probity, transparency and accountability to the commission within a short time,” Isiguzo said. He emphasised the need for collaboration between the commission and NUJ in advancing the cause of peaceful coexistence and democratic values in the country.
