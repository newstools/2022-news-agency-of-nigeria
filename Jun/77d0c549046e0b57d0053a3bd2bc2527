By Emmanuel Antswen The Benue Internal Revenue Service (BIRS) said it intercepted 10 trucks loaded with farm produce that were attempting to escape from the state to evade tax payment. This is contained in a statement by Mr Suswam Terhemba, Media Assistant to BIRS’ Executive Chairman, Mrs Mimi Adzape-Orubibi on Wednesday in Makurdi. Terhemba said the BIRS boss led the team between 1:0 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., and intercepted the culprits while they were attempting to exit the state to evade tax payment. “Ten trucks, commonly known as 911, laden with various farm produce have been intercepted by the Executive Chairman BIRS, Mrs Mimi Adzape-Orubibi, for evading tax while attempting to exit the state. “The team, led by the Executive Chairman during the early hours of between 1:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. arrested the evading trucks and marketers,” said Terhembe. He said the tax boss expressed shock that the trucks, which loaded the goods from Ihugh and Lessel, were able to beat all BIRS inspection and monitoring points and were about exiting the state. He said the intercepted trucks would have succeeded in evading tax payment amounting to over N500,000 if not for her swift response. He added that over 20 other trucks had escaped before the team’s arrival. Terhembe said the BIRS Chairman promised to thoroughly investigate the incident and fish out possible collaborators. He added that the intercepted trucks would be made to pay the due taxes and penalties before they are released. The statement added that the trucks were all moved to BIRS headquarters and impounded.
