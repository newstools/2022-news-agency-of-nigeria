By Victor Okoye Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo on Thursday in Abuja said kickstarting their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaign on a winning note was very crucial. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that first-half goals by Alex Iwobi and Victor Osimhen made the difference as the Super Eagles won 2-1 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium. They struck back after Sierra Leone took a shock early lead in a display that was hardly the most convincing. Aribo told newsmen at a post-match conference that their match day one victory against Sierra Leone was important. He said it would help the team gain momentum ahead of their remaining fixtures in the campaign. “I think it’s very important that we got off to a winning start in our first game, because we want to take the momentum into the next game on Monday. “So, kick-starting our campaign on a high and getting all three-points in our kitty was very crucial,” the Glasgow Rangers player said. On the team’s unconvincing performance against the Leone Stars, Aribo said the team would get better with each game. “We know ourselves. We could have played better, but I think we will improve with the more games we play. “It’s our first game at home together as a group with the new coach, but the team is going to improve as we continue to play together. “We are working with new tactics and philosophy. So, it is a gradual process. “We are definitely going to get better and stronger in the games to come,” he said. The Super Eagles will now turn their attention to their next match against Sao Tomé and Principe in Marrakech, Morocco on Monday.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng) =========== Edited by Olawale Alabi
