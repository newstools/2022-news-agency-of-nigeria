The APC presidential candidate said, “Today, I join the family, friends and associates to congratulate Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, as he attains 60. “He has made important contributions to Edo State and Nigeria as he has done to our party, the All Progressives Congress. “One of the founders of APC, Pastor Ize-Iyamu was Vice-Chairman of that important Constitution Drafting Committee that worked on the ground norm of APC at inception,” he said.
