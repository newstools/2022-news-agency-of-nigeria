By Ismail AbdulAziz The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) on Tuesday inaugurated the media team for the 2022 pilgrimage. The team is made up of journalists from the print, broadcast and online media organisations across states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Chairman of NAHCON, Alhaji Zikrullah Hassan, urged members of the team to project the image of the country accurately while in the Holy Land. He said “you were chosen as professional media men and women and as Muslims. We expect nothing other than the best from you. “We appeal to you to adhere to the rules and regulations of the host country, Saudi Arabia, to be at par with its standard.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-46470 size-large" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/42773A20-D296-48D3-AC43-F58B704D0E56-1024x331.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="207" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/42773A20-D296-48D3-AC43-F58B704D0E56-1024x331.jpeg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/42773A20-D296-48D3-AC43-F58B704D0E56-300x97.jpeg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/42773A20-D296-48D3-AC43-F58B704D0E56-768x248.jpeg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/42773A20-D296-48D3-AC43-F58B704D0E56-scaled.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> Hassan said that the management team of NAHCON would continue to provide the best services to pilgrims before, during and after the Hajj. “To provide efficient service, the entire management and those on directorate cadre in the commission will not perform Hajj this year. “We will be in Makkah but not engage in the rituals of Hajj in order to serve Nigerian pilgrims. “We want to be able to provide full service without hindrance or going against the Islamic tenet of Hajj operations. “We will be on ground to meet the needs of pilgrims at all times. We hope to fully satisfy our pilgrims and leave a legacy as upheld by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.”   <img class="alignnone wp-image-46469 size-large" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4799A087-EDBD-410B-AEF0-41AE642587F5-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4799A087-EDBD-410B-AEF0-41AE642587F5-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4799A087-EDBD-410B-AEF0-41AE642587F5-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4799A087-EDBD-410B-AEF0-41AE642587F5-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4799A087-EDBD-410B-AEF0-41AE642587F5-scaled.jpeg 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> Sheik Suleiman Momoh, the Head of Planning, Research, Information and Library Services, stressed the need for objectivity and cross checking of facts from officials of the commission.
