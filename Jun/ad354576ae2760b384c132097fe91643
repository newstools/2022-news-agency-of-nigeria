By Nefishetu Yakubu The Speaker of Edo House of Assembly, Marcus Onobun says the country has made tremendous progress irrespective of its challenges. In a statement made available to newsmen in Benin on Sunday, Onobun said that the journey since June 12, 1993 had not been without challenges. He enjoined citizens to continually pursue peace at all times, exhibit tolerance and endeavour to live in unity. “As we approach the general elections, I urged you all to get registered to be able to vote to ensure the right candidates are voted into office. “Together we can defend our democracy, we are the pride of the nation, let us uphold its honour. “Let us always remember the labours and sacrifices of our heroes past and strive to do better so that we can leave a lasting legacy for the unborn generation,” he said.
