By Ismail AbdulAziz Madinah, June 17, 2022 (NAN) Muslims in Delta have been urged to secure their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) to avoid disenfranchisement during the 2023 general elections. Alhaji Sadiq Musa, coordinator of the Delta Muslim for Omo-Agege and Commissioner at the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) disclosed on Friday to NAN. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the group is a power bloc for the actualisation the ambition of Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege of becoming Delta governor in 2023. Musa said that the Muslim community constituted a force to be reckoned with in the political arena of the state. He urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to make the PVC collection process accessible for the electorate. “The permanent voter cards is the only way that we can make our impact felt in the election for our candidate Ovie Omo-Agege. The critical mass of Muslims have the duty to support a man that will improve the development of the state. “It is only identifying with him alone, we must get our PVC and come out physically to vote for him. The time for election rigging has gone. The PVC is our power,” Musa said. He called on Muslims in the state to continue to participate actively in the political process of the state in order to have a voice to be identified with. Musa, who is a chieftain of the All Progressive Party (APC) in Delta, said the party must be given all the necessary to succeed at all the levels of elections in both the state and federal.(NAN)
