The FCT Police command had also announced traffic diversions, affecting many routes leading to Eagle Square, the venue of the epoch event. Spokesperson for the command, DSP Josephine Adeh, said in a statement that it had also mapped out an operational order. This, she said, was to allow maximum deployment of human and material resources for the success of the convention. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Salif Atojoko
