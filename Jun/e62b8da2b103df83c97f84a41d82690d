By Polycarp Auta Super Eagles skipper Ahmed Musa on Friday advised Nigerians to be wary of and also stop patronising fake social media accounts created in his name. Musa said such fake accounts created on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms in his name were aimed at defrauding unsuspecting members of the public. Musa, in a statement released in Jos, added that some of these fake accounts were being used by criminal elements to defraud innocent people. He decried the activities of the fraudsters and said they were aimed at tarnishing his image, that of his football academy and agents. ”I wish to advise the general public not to engage anyone using fake Facebook, Twitter or any social media accounts in my name, my agents or representatives to discuss football or any financial transaction. ”The operators of such accounts have been deceiving and defrauding innocent people about a non-existent football academy and other deals, thereby bringing my name and integrity to disrepute. ”Members of the public are hereby advised that I don’t run my football academy and Sports Centre online. ”The recruitment and engagement processes are never virtual and no one should request for money from them virtually,” Musa added. He said it was therefore in the best interest of members of the public to verify every social media handle and information before being used as a cheap prey to swindlers. Musa, however, promised to use his activated cyber security agents to go after the fraudsters and ensure they were brought to justice. He listed his verifiable social media accounts as follows: Ahmed Musa MON on Facebook and @Ahmedmusa718 on Twitter. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) ========== Edited by Olawale Alabi
