By Ikenna Osuoha Initiative for Leadership Development and Change (ILDC), an Abuja-based NGO on Tuesday commended Nigeria Police for approving new dressing code for female officers. Chief Ugochukwu Nnam, National Coordinator, made the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the occasion of International Women’s Day (IWD). NAN reports that the Nigerian Police force (NPF) through the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has approved a new dress code for female officers in the force. With the approval of this new dress code, female officers in the force are now allowed to wear hijabs, stud earrings under their berets or peak caps while in uniforms. Nnam described the policy as a demonstration of solidarity and support for gender inclusiveness. “While I congratulate women on this auspicious day, I must commend the Nigeria Police Force for approving a new dress code for female officers. “The liberty now given to women to dress as women in line with their tradition or belief further breaks the chains of subjugation which women have suffered for so long,” he said. The national coordinator, who congratulated women on their day, urged them to continue to advance the humanity through their actions wherever they find themselves. According to him, women are indispensable in the society and so require special treatment and inclusiveness. He affirmed the readiness of his group to continue to support policies that promote gender equality in Nigeria. NAN reports that March 8 annually is set aside for the celebration of International Women’s Day and that this year’s theme is “Break the Bias.” (NAN)
