By Franca Ofili The Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) says it will embark on its Cash Transfer Scheme to 2.5 million people in North West and North Central Nigeria in its effort to address hunger and malnutrition. Mr Anthony Abah, the Branch Secretary, NRCS Benue, gave this indication in Makurdi during a training session to equip staff and volunteers on the disbursement of the CTP programme. He said that “in 2022, the society wishes to embark on its scheme to cushion or even avert totally the effects of hunger and malnutrition in Benue, Niger, Nasarawa, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and Sokoto states.” He said the training was to enlighten staff and volunteers on “Hunger Crisis Intervention”, Community Engagement and Accountability (CEA). Others, he said, are protection and gender inclusion, as volunteers were taught modalities and methodology of the disbursement. According to him, the society is a voluntary aid society and an auxiliary to the Nigerian Government whose raison d’etre (main reason) is to alleviate human suffering. He said the mission of the society was also to alleviate the situation of the vulnerable people which includes those affected by disaster, epidemics, armed conflicts. Abah said the society caters for the poorest communities in both urban and rural areas, amongst whom are women, children, the aged, displaced and other vulnerable people. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
