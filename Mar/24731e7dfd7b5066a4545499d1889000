For three weeks now, we have been playing local derbies, we won the first, drew the second and lost the third. “Today, we know that we needed to win. I was a little bit tense in the beginning of the game. “But I didn’t underrate Oyah FC, even though they are yet to win any game, but I was sure that my team would deliver,” Sani said. On his part, coach Abdulrazak Mohammed of Oyah Sports FC said his team needed to improve its mental state. “We are doing everything possible to get out of this situation. “The game today went well but I think the team needs to improve on its mentality. Losing all matches so far in the season is not a good one and can affect the players. “So, we will try to correct a lot of things in the team before our next game,” Mohammed added. (NAN)
