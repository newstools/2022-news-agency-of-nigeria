By Ikenna Uwadileke The President, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), Dr Al-Mujtaba Abubakar, has lamented the human loss and injuries recorded on Monday night following the attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train. Abubakar, in a statement he issued on Tuesday in Abuja, described the incident as “gruesome and inhuman”. The ACCI president, who noted the continuous human tragedies occasioned by frequent attacks on innocent Nigerians, called the train attack “one of the most horrible human tragedies in the country.” Describing how the Abuja-Kaduna train is the lifeline of business and human operations in North Western Nigeria, Abubakar bemoaned the intractable bandit conflicts despite government’s efforts to secure lives and property. He urged the Federal Government to fast track procurement of surveillance equipment to make the rail services more secure. “I console the families of victims and pray for the safe return of those abducted. “The procurement and installation of those equipment will pre-empt attacks and help security agencies to secure the railway lines. “The Abuja-Kaduna line is strategic as the lifeline of business and passengers between the North and the nation’s capital city. “We cannot recount how much has been lost but we can redeem the situation by speeding up all efforts at safety and security on our transportation system,” Abubakar said. The News Agency of Nigeria  (NAN) reports that the Nigeria Railway Corporation suspended the Abuja-Kaduna operations after bandits attacked the 6pm train on Monday with many feared kidnapped while others sustained injuries.
