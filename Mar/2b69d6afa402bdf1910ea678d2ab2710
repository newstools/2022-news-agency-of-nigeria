By Abujah Racheal Girls Voices Initiative, an NGO, has described the 2022 International Women’s Day (IWD) hashtag — #BreakTheBias, as “symbol of the enduring barriers faced by women in workplaces and other areas.” The group’s Creative Director, Mrs Carolyn Seaman, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja, on the sidelines of the Women’s International Film Festival Nigeria (WIFFEN 2022) award. The 2022 IWD celebration, which has “Gender Equality Today For A Sustainable Tomorrow”, has #BreakTheBias as its hashtag. The award was organised by the NGO’s Nation Academy, in partnership with the French Embassy’s PISCCA Programme and other partners. Seaman said the premier WIFFEN award was in commemoration of the 2022 IWD, annually observed on March 8 to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political accomplishments of women across the globe. She added that gender inequality and bias had led to women and girls in the country having uneven access to healthcare, education and other basic needs. “This is why we are honouring deserving women in the film industry, in partnership with the French Embassy’s PISCCA Programme. “The honour is part of efforts to recognise and celebrate the immense contributions of women to the film industry. “The 2022 IWD celebration aims to project a world that will be free of bias, stereotypes and discrimination.’’ Seaman explained that like International Women’s Day, the WIFFEN 2022 focused on encouraging female filmmakers across the country and to be at their best in their chosen profession. She added that “on this IWD, I just want to wish for more love and kindness in the world and the divine female energy in each of us, male or female, to shine bright through our hearts.” (NAN)
