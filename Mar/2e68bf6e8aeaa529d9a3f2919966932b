By Sylvester Thompson Dr Victoria Enape, President, Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPIN), has urged the Federal Government to assent to the bill establishing the Institute. Enape made the call at a news conference in Abuja on Saturday. She said that the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals Bill, 2021, had scaled through all the legislative hurdles of the 9th National Assembly and was currently before the president for assent. She said forensic investigation was not only vital for the restoration of the nation’s economy but crucial in the fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrime. According to her, this is in line with the policy thrust of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Enape said that government was open minded towards any laudable initiative which is geared towards enhancing the relevant legal and institutional frameworks in the country. She said that any proposal or proposed legislation in this regards should be painstakingly considered, based on merit. Enape, however, stressed that the fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrime in the country should be seen as an all-inclusive fight. “It should not be limited by any propaganda of any existing organisation who are determined to arrogate the right to regulate certain sector of our economy to themselves alone,” she said. She said as a nation, Nigerians must put on thinking caps to ensure collaboration and synergy with the rest of the world as this will match the high tech level of crimes in today’s digital revolution.
