Senegal’s President Macky Sall, and Moussa Faki Mahamat, head of African Union (AU) Commission in a joint statement said it was unacceptable for Africans to be treated differently in Ukraine,  calling it racism. “Reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and a breach in international law,” the statement said. The AU was reacting to reports that African citizens in Ukraine are being refused the right to cross borders to safety as they try to flee the conflict in Ukraine. According to the statement, all people have the right to cross international borders during conflict, and should enjoy the same rights to cross to safety from the conflict in Ukraine, notwithstanding their nationality or racial identity. Thousands of African and other foreign nationals, particularly students, have been scrambling to leave Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. However, as thousands throng to Ukraine’s borders, overwhelming authorities in neighbouring countries, reports have emerged that Africans are being treated differently and sometimes prevented from leaving. Several have shared videos and testimonies on social media, denouncing discrimination at train stations and border posts. Reuters has not been able to authenticate the videos. (Reuters/NAN)
