By Sumaila Ogbaje Troops of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), have successfully overrun and captured the stronghold of the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists at Ukuba/Camp Zairo, in Sambisa Forest. The Director, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, in a statement on Friday in Abuja, said the troops also seized weapons from the terrorists. Onyeuko said the feat was achieved on Thursday in a Special operation codenamed “Operation Desert Sanity.” He said the troops routed the terrorists and captured their enclave, adding that the terrorists fled the camp leaving behind their weapons. Onyeuko said, “after thorough cordon and search of the captured camp, the gallant troops recovered various equipment including one Main Battle Tank, one 155mm Bofors Gun, one Trailer, one 122mm Gun and two 105mm Guns. “Other equipment captured are one Mines Resistance Ambush Protected (MRAP), fighting vehicle, one MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carrier, one Mack Trailer, as well as large cache of arms and ammunition left behind by the terrorists.” The Defence spokesman said the capture of the terrorists’ stronghold of ‘Camp Zairo’ was a major setback to the terrorists and criminals. He said the military High Command had commended the troops for the success and enjoined them not to rest on their oars. He added, “but use this as a springboard to finally defeat the insurgents and also keep up the fighting spirit.” (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
