By Emmanuel Afonne Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta on Wednesday congratulated the General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, as he clocked 80 years. A statement signed by Okowa’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, described Adeboye as a distinguished man of God who had contributed immensely to the growth of Christendom. Okowa lauded Adeboye for his humility and outstanding patriotism, especially in guiding the flock of Christ since he assumed the position of the General Overseer of the church. He also commended him for his consistent assistance to the needy in society. The governor said that Adeboye’s place in history was replete with accomplishments in God’s vineyard where he had mentored many clerics and raised churches in the last 40 years. “On behalf of my family, the government and people of Delta, I congratulate you, our highly revered cleric, on your 80th birth anniversary. “Under your faithful stewardship, the RCCG experienced unprecedented growth, spreading beyond Nigeria’s shores to other continents of the world. “The monthly Holy Ghost Service of your church is renowned for signs and wonders, with millions of lives saved from sin and delivered from demonic bondages. “As you mark this octogenarian landmark anniversary, I wish you more years of fruitful ministry in the vineyard of the Lord and service to humanity,” Okowa said.
