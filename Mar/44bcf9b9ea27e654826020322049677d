The minister said the gap of the infrastructural need is steadily being bridged by a gradual process of repairs, renewal and construction on major highways. “It is true that we can have the best quality of infrastructure and good environment, hence we are expressing renewed enthusiasm with regard to some defective roads that have been rehabilitated. “It is undebatable that quality of various institutions will be impacted by quality infrastructure, learning environment and those who doubt it should simply listen to some of the feedbacks from the benefitting communities where this type of intervention has taken place. “We have successfully intervened in the internal road networks of 46 tertiary federal institutions and handed over 29 as at 2021 and we now have another 17 ready to be handed over. “The ministry is currently attending to 30 roads in similar institutions across the country making a total of 76. “This is consistent with our progressive idea of improving the human condition and that process continue here today as we hand over this road to the hospital as a critical intervention to support a good and ideal environment,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-39546" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Aminu-Kano-Teaching-Hospital-AKTH-1280x720-1-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Aminu-Kano-Teaching-Hospital-AKTH-1280x720-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Aminu-Kano-Teaching-Hospital-AKTH-1280x720-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Aminu-Kano-Teaching-Hospital-AKTH-1280x720-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Aminu-Kano-Teaching-Hospital-AKTH-1280x720-1.png 1116w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> He said that 83 people were employed during the construction process, thereby contributing to job creation initiatives of government, urging the hospital to ensure that the asset is used properly and not abused.
