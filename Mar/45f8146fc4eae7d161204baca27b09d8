By Patricia Amogu A youth activist, Mr John Ebokpo, aspiring for House of Representatives in 2023 in Abuja, appealed to the youth in Nigeria to actively get more involved in politics. Ebokpo, who aspires to represent Obubara/Etung Federal Constituency of Cross River, on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). According to him, the time has come for youths to take their rightful place in politics because they possess so much political and economic powers. “Our nationalists that fought for Nigeria’s independence were youths and they did a good job. “But now the reverse is the case and we keep living on the assertion that youths are the leaders of tomorrow. “The tomorrow we desire is now,” Ebokpo said. He said that Nigeria must properly harness the potential in the youth to move the country forward. According to him, a unified youth population is what this country needs to liberate from political and economic woes. “The functionality of any country is in its economy and youths population. “In this era of changing global businesses with so much reliance on artificial intelligence, the fintech, e-commerce, sports tourism, entertainment industry are in the control and operation of the youth. “If the potential in the youth are properly harnessed, the country will develop faster,” he said. Ebokpo said that the need to create a platform that would inspire the youth to bring to bear their expertise and potential inspired him to seek for elective position into the house of representatives.
