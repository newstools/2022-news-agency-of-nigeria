He said the 10-day tour was aimed at preparing the state team for all their local and national competitions. ”We are happy cricket is growing in Kaduna State as currently we are champions in male category. ”There is no competition we attended that we did not win a gold medal. ”This is making our team to wax stronger and will continue to do our best,” he said. He said the tour was sponsored by Gov. Nasiru El-Rufai. He said the association would be engaging in series of friendly matches with Uganda, Kenyan, Botswana and other selected sides. “This is the third time we are going for the tour series. “The state’s cricket team got its chance to experience cricket outside of Nigeria last two years with the support of the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasiru Ahmed El-Rufai, who became the first governor in the country to sponsor the state’s cricket team to travel out to play cricket. “The team travelled to Kampala in Uganda which saw them compete in a 3-day series and take part in a number of pre-season matches. ”We won all our matches during the visit and hope to continue winning during this year’s series. “We are expecting them to play on the pitch and when the play in our pitch, it automatically becomes international pitch and this will be the first in the whole of West Africa,” he said.
