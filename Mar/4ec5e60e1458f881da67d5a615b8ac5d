Ban Canada will ban the import of Russian crude oil in response to the country’s military operation in Ukraine, Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau said. “Today, we are announcing as well our intention to ban all import of crude oil from Russia,” Trudeau told a news conference. On Feb. 24, Russia launched a special operation in Ukraine, responding to calls from the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics for help from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defense Ministry said the operation was solely targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and emphasised that the civilian population was not in danger. The United States and its European partners responded by imposing unprecedented sanctions targeting several major Russian banks and high-level Russian government officials. (Sputnik/NAN)
