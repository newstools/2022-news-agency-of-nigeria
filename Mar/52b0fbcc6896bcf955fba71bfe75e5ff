By Ikenna Osuoha Chief Bennett Lemchi, former ANPP gubernatorial candidate in Imo on Thursday said that Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation is competent to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Lemchi told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that it was ideal for APC to cede the Presidency to ANPP block of Igbo extraction. “From the just concluded APC convention, it is clear that the founding political parties that merged to form APC have all got something apart from the ANPP bloc. “Among, the major party blocs that formed APC, CPC got the president, ACN got the vice-president, the current National Chairman is from the New PDP bloc. “ANPP bloc is supposed to produce the president by 2023,” he argued. Lemchi, therefore, called on party members to, in the spirit of fairness and equity, support a ANPP’s Chief Ogbonnaya Onu. According to him, Ogbonnaya Onu is a gentleman with visionary leadership qualities capable of taking Nigeria to greater heights. The APC chieftain said that it was equitable to support an ANPP bloc’s representative member of Igbo extraction for president by 2023. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
