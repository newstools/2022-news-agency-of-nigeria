By Ijeoma Okigbo Visiting Sokoto United secured their first win of the ongoing 2021/2022 Nigeria National League (NNL) season by beating Oyah Sports FC of Abuja 3-1 on Saturday. In their Group A1 fixture played at the Area 10 pitch, an Uche Collins brace and Mouktar Umar’s solitary strike gave the visitors their first win in four matches. Sokoto United dominated the Match Day 4 game well enough in the first half and Collins gave them the opening goal in the 20th minute. The second half saw the home team overcoming their seeming lethargy, applying more pressure on their opponents and this eventually paid off with William Ude’s  62nd minute equaliser. Collins responded four minutes later for the Sokoto United team as he reclaimed the lead for his team. Umar, however, sealed the victory for his team as he scored during a goal scramble two minutes into added time. After the game, Martial Amodu, an excited captain of Sokoto United, lauded the team for the effort. “I am so happy with this win, especially as our state’s Commissioner of Sports, Bashir Usman, is here to watch us. It is such an amazing feeling. “I appreciate the efforts of the team. We all put in our best to see that we are successful today. “Our next game is at home against Zamfara United and I am sure that we are going to sustain this tempo and secure maximum points,” Amodu said. On his part, Abdulrazak Mohammed, coach of Oyah FC, who are yet to pick a point in three matches, said the team needed to correct a few lapses. “Today, we didn’t play like a team. The players didn’t perform to instructions. Although the officiating was fair, there are a lot of things we need to get right. “We will go back to the drawing board and prepare better ahead of our next game against EFCC FC,” Mohammed said.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
