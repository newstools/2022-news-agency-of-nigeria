Julius Toba-Jegede Leaders of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ife Federal Constituency on Monday adopted the candidature of Prince (Dr) Ayoade Adewopo, for the House of Representatives in 2023 General Elections. Adewopo’s adoption followed a meeting held in Ile-Ife on Monday afternoon where leadership of the party in a unanimous decision agreed to support him as the sole candidate to represent them in the 10th National Assembly. The resolution of the leaders signed by Mr Wale Ojo, and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reiterated Adewopo’s commitment to the party and the constituency, including his unalloyed loyalty and support for the party at all times. The resolution urged members of PDP across the constituency to give their maximum support and cooperation to the aspirant in his bid to fly the flag of the party in the coming general elections. It further indicated that a motion for the adoption which was moved at the end of their meeting was supported and approved by the leaders in a unanimous voice vote. When contacted by NAN to react to the development, Adewopo said it was not a surprise that his people want him to represent them through such a unanimous decision. He attributed their decision to the love the people of Ife Federal Constituency have for him and his record of communal support for the people in the past. He thanked the leaders for what he described as their bold step, with a promise that he would not disappoint them if eventually voted into office. NAN reports that Adewopo was one of the PDP governorship aspirants in 2018, who was reportedly asked by the leadership of the party to step down since the deputy governorship slot was zoned to the same constituency he hails from.
