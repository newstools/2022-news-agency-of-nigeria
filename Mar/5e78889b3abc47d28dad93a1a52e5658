The Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) Lobby Group in Cross River, Oden Ewa has advised Nigerian youth to exploit the opportunities provided by the new Electoral Act by massively participating in politics. Ewa, in an interview with newsmen in Abuja said it was time for the youths to take their pride of place in the leadership and governance of the country. The chairman, who commended President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to the contentious Electoral Bill, described the gesture as one of the landmark achievements of the president. He said that the new Act would add value to Nigeria’s electoral system which hitherto suffered backlashes from election monitors and international community. “This singular action of Mr President has proven that he is very serious about sanitising the electoral system through enduring reforms. “We are also aware of his sweeping reforms in the oil and gas sector as well as agriculture sector among others. “By assenting to the Electoral Bill, President Buhari has returned power to the people. “He has restored our voices, validating that indeed power belongs to the people. “Now we can truly say that Nigeria is inching closer to practicing true democracy, a government of the people, by the people and for the people,” Ewa said. The group chairman said that with the coming to effect of the electoral Act, “Nigerians now have the power to determine who will govern or represent them, as their votes will now count.” He was of the view that election would be freer and fairer in the country henceforth. He observed that the era of electoral brigandage and unwholesome manipulation of poll results would cease to exist. “It will no longer be business as usual. The ‘carry go’ syndrome will naturally fade away,” he said. The lobby group chairman averred that hijacking of ballot boxes and ballot stuffing during election would be flushed down to history as the country would begin to witness more credible polls in the future.(NAN)(www.nannwes.ng)
