Ogaji said to ensure electricity sustainability in the country, stakeholders in the sector must address the root causes of the current erratic power supply and not the symptoms. “Let us fix the power sector, instead of the blame game. We want to sit with government and look at the issues and come up with  solutions that will improve electricity supply. “As a matter of urgency, we want to have a sit-down with government, if we want sustainability of power in the market. According to Ogaji, the current state of the national grid must be addressed in order to stop denying Nigerians their legitimate expectation of unhindered and reliable electricity supply. She also disclosed that the poor management of the grid had affected the performance of the GenCos and damaged some units of their infrastructure. Specifically, she said they engaged the services of an expert the previous year to look into the problem and the expert discovered  that the machines were not operating optimally. Ogaji said GenCos could generate 8000 megawatts – 9000 Megawatts  of electricity if the power sector could get things right. The Executive Secretary also disclosed that load rejection had been a major problem affecting their performance. “As at now we are generating an average of  4000MW and above ,  we hope to generate more,” she said Ogaji said that GenCos had consistently demonstrated their commitment to Nigeria, Nigerians, and the power sector. “We have continued to make huge sacrifices and bear inestimable losses in our bid to see to a virile and thriving power sector that will benefit all and sundry.
