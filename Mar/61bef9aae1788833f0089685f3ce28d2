By olasade Akpan Mr Buki Ponle, the Managing Director, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has pledged to give women in the organisation the necessary support they need to excel. He made the pledge on Tuesday in Abuja, when some female members of staff paid him a visit in commemoration of the International Women’s Day celebration. Ponle, while extolling the numerous virtues of the womenfolk, said that if given the opportunity, women would give their best to the society. “I will always be there to support you and give you the necessary tools to make your job easier,’’ he said. According to him, those who put women at the back row are just undoing and punishing themselves and their society. “So we always defer to remember because I know their essence and their importance and I know that without women, men cannot move anywhere. “I am happy to note that if you go to any graduation ceremony in the universities, you will see that women outnumber men and it means that women are coming up. “Maybe that is why some men are afraid to let women have their roles in the society,’’ he said. Ponle said that women would always have a soft spot for men and for their children, adding that was only applicable to men who treat them nice. He added that, “So for this special day, I congratulate you for your numerous strides and I believe that you will continue to make your mark in any area of calling.’’ The maiden IWD celebration was held in 1911 and in 1975, the United Nations declared March 8 as International Women’s Day. NAN reports that IWD is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The 2022 theme is: “Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow’’. (NAN)
