By Ahmed Ubandoma Aisha, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday in Abuja commended Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) (Doctors without Border) for its humanitarian efforts. MSF is an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in countries affected by endemic diseases. Aisha particularly commended MSF for its efforts at providing medical needs of vulnerable people in Nigeria. She spoke through the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Women Affairs and Administration, Dr Rukayyatu Gorin, when a delegation from MSF led by its Nigeria`s Country Representative, Dr Simba Tirima, visited the State House. Dr Gorin received the MSF delegation on behalf of Aisha Buhari. <img src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-20220307-WA0014-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-37758" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-20220307-WA0014-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-20220307-WA0014-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-20220307-WA0014-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG-20220307-WA0014.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> She noted that the MSF and Aisha’s NGO, the Aisha Buhari Foundation (ABF) had a lot in common especially in providing medical outreaches to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). She particularly appreciated the commitment of the MSF in providing medical support to victims of conflicts in Borno, Zamfara, Katsina states and other parts of the country. Gorin said ABF had supported victims of insurgency in the northeast and also supported victims of natural disasters, especially in the establishment of maternity clinics in some states. “We have done a lot of humanitarian interventions through the Aisha Buhari Foundation and Future Assured Programme; we have dedicated ourselves to addressing the plight of women and children,’’ she said. She expressed the desire to strengthen partnership between the two NGOs to address the needed medical and other humanitarian needs of vulnerable people, especially women and children. Earlier, Tirima said the MSF delegation visited the State House to intimate Aisha Buhari with its various humanitarian interventions in hard-to-reach areas of Nigeria. Tirima said, the MSF had been in Nigeria since 1996, providing humanitarian support to victims of natural disasters. According to him, the organisation is currently operating in 10 states across the country, providing employment to 3,000 thousand Nigerians in different sectors. In his remarks, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs and Strategy, Malam Sani Zoro, expressed optimism that the meeting would provide a platform for consolidating various agreements with other international NGOs. “We are at a point where Aisha Buhari Foundation and Future Assured are consolidating on the various partnerships they have with other international NGOs,’’ Zoro said.
