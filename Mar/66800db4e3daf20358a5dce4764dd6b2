By Salisu Sani-Idris The Alliance of Northern Progressive Youths (ANPY), has endorsed ex-Nassarawa governor, Sen. Tanko Al-Makura for the All Progressives Congress (APC), National Chairman position ahead of its March 26 National Convention. The group’s Director, Gender and Governance, Ms Amina Wakawa, disclosed this at a news conference on Friday in Abuja. She said that Al-Makura was a thoroughbred politician with manifest experience in party administration, governance and legislative procedures. Wakawa said that Al-Makura represented the right mix of accomplished leadership qualities that would not only add value to the APC but would also facilitate, sustain and build on the successes recorded by the party so far. She explained that the northern youths decided to support Almakura because of his contribution during the historic merger of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria People’s Party (ANPP) and Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). <img src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FB_IMG_1646999693533-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-38195" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FB_IMG_1646999693533-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FB_IMG_1646999693533-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FB_IMG_1646999693533-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FB_IMG_1646999693533-1024x1280.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FB_IMG_1646999693533-scaled.jpg 502w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /> She said that Al-Makura was the only former governor elected on CPC’s platform, and who had contributed greatly to the successes of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 general elections, which ended the 16 years of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leadership. Wakawa said that the emergence of Al-Makura as APC national chairman would be a reward for loyalty, hard work, competence and ensure justice, equity and fairness. “Putting into consideration the fact that it is only CPC to which Al-Makura belonged that is yet to produce the party national chairman among the three legacy parties that formed APC in 2014. “Al-Makura also delivered many national assignments given to him by the party’s national headquarters, especially as Chairman APC Primary Election Committee in Ekiti State. “And APC National Reconciliation Committee for the North-East states among his other numerous contributions. “Therefore, as the party gets set for the National Convention slated for March 26 with Al-Makura indicating interest to lead the party as its National Chairman, we believe that he is a round peg in a round hole.” Wakawa, therefore, called on the leadership of APC to avoid imposition of any candidate in the name of consensus or alleged endorsement. “We believe President Muhammadu Buhari is a man of integrity, who respects the provisions of the law and national interest, and will not support the imposition of any candidate in the party. “APC as the ruling party must ensure internal party democracy with a view to deepening democratic culture in the country. “And the party should not entrust the leadership of the party in the hands of those who fought democracy and the party during its formative days in the country,” Wakawa said.
