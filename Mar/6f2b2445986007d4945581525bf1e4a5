By Hussaaina Yakubu Kaduna State Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Aisha Dikko,says the state government is committed to the speedy dispensation of justice following the recent enactment of the State’s Administration of Criminal Justice Law. The commissioner spoke on Thursday in Kaduna at a one-day seminar and retreat with the theme, ‘’Kaduna State Administration of Criminal Justice Law Monitoring Committee:The journey so far”. Dikko explained that the Law was enacted to promote efficient management of criminal justice institutions and speedy dispensation of justice. According to her, the law seeks to protect the society from crime, as well as protect the rights of suspects, defendants and victims.  Dikko also highlighted what both the Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee and the Ministry of Justice had been doing to ensure compliance with the Administration of Criminal Justice Law. She said the committee, in collaboration with  the ministry and  in consultation with the judiciary, had instituted a plea bargain committee, with a manual to guide parties seeking to explore plea bargain approach  in settlement of matters. The Attorney-General argued that plea bargain was necessitated by the need to conclude criminal proceedings in little or no time, with all parties going home as winners, having been able to come to a consensus. ‘’This in turn saves the time of the court, decongests its docket and decongests the custodial centres, thus saving tax payers monies and saving the state the time and cost of prosecution. ”It also gives the victim, an almost certain compensation, and the defendant, the opportunity to purge his or herself of an offence,’’ she added. The commissioner also said that the committee and the ministry had fashioned out a sentencing guideline aimed at aiding the court in deciding appropriate sentences to pass on defendants upon conclusion of criminal proceedings.
