By Ruth Oketunde Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, a former Senate President and a 2023 PDP presidential aspirant, has condemned the attack on a Kaduna-bound train on Monday, describing it as ‘barbaric and inhumane’. He made the condemnation on Tuesday in Abuja in a statement signed by Ahmed Buhari, spokesman of his presidential campaign organisation. Anyim also cancelled all his political activities and consultation tours for the rest of the week in honour of those who lost their lives and those still being held by the bandits. He prayed for quick recovery for the wounded and comfort for the families that lost their loved ones. The senator expressed deep sorrow over the fate of innocent Nigerians, some of whom lost their lives, got injured or being held hostage or traumatised as a result of the wicked act of the criminals. The senator recalled his open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2021, in which he counselled the government that military actions alone would not solve the current insecurity problems in the country. He recommended to the government that a process akin to the Willinks Commission of 1958 be thoroughly looked into in order to find lasting solutions to the issues that were fueling insecurity and disharmony in Nigeria. Anyim said that whatever had pushed Nigerians into killing their fellow citizens in these large numbers and at such frequency was serious enough to command the urgent attention of both the government and every leader in the country. He urged the security agencies to spare no effort in rescuing the passengers of the ill-fated train that were still being held by the criminals. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
