By Stephen Adeleye The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), an NGO on Tuesday, trained mentor mothers on bridging the gap in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV/AIDS. Speaking, Mrs Christie Awunor, the AHF State Nursing Coordinator for Abuja, Kogi and Nasarrawa, said the training was organised by AHF to mark the International Women’s Day (IWD) 2022, with the theme: ”Break The Bias”, in Kabba, Kogi. She noted that the training was to educate the mentor mothers more on PMTCT in order to support the AHF programme  on HIV/AIDS prevention and advocacy in the state. According to her, mentor mothers are HIV-positive women who serve as counselors for PMTCT clients, provide guidance and support in keeping appointments and promoting anti retroviral adherence and retention-in-care. She stressed that the programme  would enable the mentor mothers to work in collaboration with health workers and other peer educators to encourage, educate and empower HIV-positive pregnant women and new mothers in the communities. She encouraged the women to be brave and break harmful biases in their lives, and bringing about positive change in their communities and in the lives of their friends and families. The Kogi  Coordinator of AHF, Dr Onyeyili Ikemefuna, said AHF being gender sensitive was using the IWD to reflect on the sacrifices, celebrating and highlighting the achievements of strong and successful women globally. He stressed that the AHF had been standing strong with women living with HIV, reduced the scourge, and had effectively prevented mother-to-child transmission in Kogi. ”Together, we can all help ‘Break the Bias’ and build a more equitable, inclusive future for women everywhere, particularly in Kogi ”, he said. One of the participants, Remilekun Michael, thanked AHF for the gesture,  assuring that they would go back to train their various communities. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
