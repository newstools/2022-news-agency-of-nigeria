He said that motorists must ensure that their windshield wipers, brake lights, headlamps, indicator lights, parking lights and others are working perfectly before putting them on the road. Alonge also cautioned them against the use of expired and worn out tyres, adding that their braking systems must be perfect too. “Motorists  must ensure that  their vehicles are in good  conditions with functional systems like windshield  wipers, headlamps, indicator lights, brake lights, rear lights, parking lights and the braking systems. “Expired tyres are dangerous on the roads especially during the rains, so motorists must ensure they use new tyres in order to safeguard  lives and property,” he  said.
