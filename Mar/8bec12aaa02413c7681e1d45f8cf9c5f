By Alaba-Olusola Oke Mrs Taiwo Adeyemi, a pharmacist and member, Ondo State Committee on Drugs Control, has advised pregnant women against taking unprescribed  drugs. She gave the advice during sensitisation on dangers of drug abuse at the General Hospital, Owo in Owo Local Government Area on Wednesday. She said such drugs were capable of adversely affecting unborn babies. She added that mild ailments in pregnancy which ordinarily would require simple medical treatments may lead to complications if pregnant women indulged in drug abuse. Adeyemi, therefore, urged pregnant women to always consult qualified medical doctors at recognised government health facilities whenever they experience any health challenge. Mrs Yetunde Jeyifous, the Assistant Commander of Narcotics in charge of Drugs Demand Reduction Unit, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Ondo State Command, advised expectant mothers to prioritise their health and that of their unborn babies. She also advised them to consult qualified medical personnel at recognised government facilities whenever they felt any unusual change. Mrs Victoria Fawonre, the Assistant Chief Matron in the hospital, described the campaign against non-prescribed drugs as educative for pregnant women. She said majority of expectant mothers were not aware of the dangers of drug abuse and its negative consequences. She urged members of the committee to extend the awareness and sensitisation to other pregnant women in other health facilities in the state. An expectant mother, Mrs Oluwaseun Arowolo, who commended the state government, said many lives would be saved as a result of the exercise. (NAN)
