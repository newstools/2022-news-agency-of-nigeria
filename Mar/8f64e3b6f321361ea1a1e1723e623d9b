By Ahmed Abba Yobe State Drugs and Medical Consumables Management Agency (YODMA), says it constructed six zonal medical warehouses to reduce costs for logistics movement across the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Lawan Gana, disclosed this while commissioning one of the warehouses in Potiskum on Friday. Gana said the zonal warehouses were set up to ensure high quality and affordable medication and to reduce costs associated with the logistics of movement. “It is not economically sensible to say that every person will have to travel to Damaturu, the state capital, to get their drugs and consumables,” he said. He explained that the law establishing the agency had provided the establishment of the six zonal facilities across the state. “As we are speaking, we have established that of Potiskum, Gashua, Nguru and Damaturu, soon we are going to have two more warehouses,” Gana added. He added that the agency has upgraded the warehouse in Damaturu in partnership with Multi Sectoral Crises Project. The commissioner said the ministry is looking up to YODMA and its associates to ensure that the healthcare facilities are adequately available on all medications. The commissioner, on behalf of Yobe government, commended the entire YODMA team for improving and upgrading healthcare services across the state. Speaking at the occasion, Abdulaziz Muhammed, the Executive Secretary, YODMA, commended “Saving One Million Lives” for being supportive. He also commended Gov. Mai Mala Buni for his efforts to reform the entire health system in the state. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
