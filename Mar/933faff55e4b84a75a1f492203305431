The Unit Commander of FRSC, Mr Joseph Akinsanya, stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun. Akinsanya said the command intended to achieve this by intensifying operations through effective patrol and quick rescue response to accident victims.

Akinsanya admonished motorists against excessive speeding, dangerous driving and driving against traffic to avoid unnecessary loss of lives and property.
