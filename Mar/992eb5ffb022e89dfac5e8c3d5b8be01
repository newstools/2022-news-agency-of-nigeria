By Diana Omueza The Young Progressives Party (YPP), says it is giving out 500 free tickets for Super Eagles fans to watch Tuesday’s World Cup qualifiers between Nigeria and Ghana in Abuja. YPP Sports Director, Oluwafemi Ajilore, said this on Monday in Abuja when he addressed newsmen at the party’s secretariat. Ajilore said that the gesture was a part of the party’s corporate social responsibility. According to him, the solidarity and support shown by Ghananians in the last match, is a booster for us. “We all know what the World Cup means to any nation and especially to our country in this continent. “If you noticed what happened in Ghana, the stadium was packed full by Ghananians. “We know that the reality of the economy may hinder participation and we know that our youths are interested in watching the match live. “We also want to see our stadium filled to capacity and that is why the NEC with the support of the national chairman have been able to mobilize 500 free tickets. “We have secured these 500 free tickets for distribution to everyone interested in watching the match live at the stadium. “We want Nigerians to come out en mass to support our darling Super Eagles and hopefully it will boost the play and we would get the winning result,” he said.
