The chairmen made this known in a communiqué issued at the end of a two-day retreat for Committee of Federal Polytechnic Rectors for Chairmen and Principal Officers of Federal Polytechnics and Chairmen and Rectors of one State Polytechnics. The communiqué was co-signed by Dr Baba Danjuma and Mr Lawal Hafiz as chairman and secretary, made available to newsmen in Abuja on Monday. They called on councils and managements to ensure that their actions and decisions conformed to the provisions of the act as well as other extant laws and circulars. They noted that the current act had lacunas, which needed to be attended to urgently, especially with each polytechnic having its own establishment act. The chairmen also highlighted the roles of the council, which included organisation, coordination and direction of the affairs of the Polytechnics. The communiqué enjoined the councils to know that the managements also had responsibilities and must therefore, collectively respect the clear distinctions between the strategic operational roles in the running of the institutions with well-articulated policies for good governance. They therefore called for reforms that would ensure anti-corruption drives in the institutions and as well institute disciplinary sanctions against financial-related offences. They also called on councils and managements to ensure transparency, accountability and effective monitoring for proper checks and balances in managing the meager financial resources under their watch. The chairmen noted with concern the effect of embargo on recruitment of quality staff to manage TVET institutions, while calling on the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation to consider the issuance of waiver for replacement of staff. They said this would help to salvage the system from imminent collapse. They also recommended that the Federal Government should as a matter of urgency establish a Ministry of Technical and Vocational Education to drive skills training for the development of entrepreneurship and TVET sector for sustainable national development. They, however, suggested the allocation of at least 20 per cent of the National budget for the funding of education and 50 per cent, which should go to TVET to fund research and development in the Polytechnics. They chairmen this would also encourage staff of the Polytechnics to undertake research and training in the industries to fill the gaps between the academics and the industry. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
