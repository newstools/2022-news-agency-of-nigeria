By Lizzy Okoji The Federal Government with the support of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has evacuated 128 more Nigerians from Libya under its continuous evacuation exercise. This is contained in a statement issued by Mr Kabiru Musa, the Charge d’ Affairs, Nigerian Mission in Libya  on Tuesday in Abuja. “They departed from the Misrata Airport, Libya on flight UZ0289 MRA and are expected to arrive the Murtala Mohammed Airport, Lagos. “The Nigerian Mission in Libya under the directives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is engaging the Libyan authorities to ensure the evacuation of stranded Nigerians,” he said. Lamenting the situation of the stranded Nigerians in Libya, Musa said the Nigerian government would continue with the evacuation until no Nigerian is left behind. “The evacuated Nigerians include men, women and children who have been victims of human trafficking, forced labour, prostitution amongst others. “We have been on a constant engagement with the Libyan authorities and even checking detention camps to ensure no Nigerian is left stranded. “A lot of them have expressed willingness to return home but cannot because of how they were trafficked irregularly. “And, that is why the Nigerian government with the assistance of the IOM is doing everything possible to get the back home. “We have officials on ground in Nigeria who are waiting to receive them to help reintegrate them into society and reunite with their families. “This is our second evacuation within one week, we have carried out series of others in the past months and we will continue to carry out more until no Nigerian is left stranded in Libya,” Musa said.
