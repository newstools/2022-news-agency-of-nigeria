By Sandra Umeh The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has commenced a forum for legal practitioners in the Diaspora to serve as a link to express their thoughts on legal issues. The association made this known in a statement in Lagos on Sunday and signed by the NBA National Publicity Secretary, Dr Rapulu Nduka. Nduka said the forum was set up in line with innovations in the amended constitution of the Bar. He recalled that one of the innovations in the recently amended NBA Constitution 2021, was the establishment of a Lawyers in the Diaspora Forum (LDF). “The forum is to serve as a platform to connect and provide a voice for all persons qualified to practice law in Nigeria, but resident outside Nigeria. “This forum will also serve as a structured platform through which all lawyers in the diaspora may contribute their quota individually and collectively to the development of the Nigerian Bar, the legal system, and the practice of law in Nigeria,” Nduka said. He said that to join thr forum, a prospective member must be qualified to practise law in Nigeria; belong to a branch of the NBA; pay his Bar practice fees, and be resident outside Nigeria. “Anyone who meets these requirements is urged to complete the form at https://forms.gle/FduB6ACviQCRcYz76,” Nduka said. According to him, the personal data provided will be used to maintain a central register for NBA lawyers in the Diaspora and to communicate directly with them on matters relating to the NBA, or the forum.
