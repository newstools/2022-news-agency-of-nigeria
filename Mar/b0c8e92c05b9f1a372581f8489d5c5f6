Fashola, while speaking at the handing over of a 1.639-km internal road at the Bayero University Kano(BUK), said that the president had approved the inauguration of several completed projects. The minister was represented by the Federal Controller of Works in Kano State, Mr Yahaya Ali. “This project represents one of the major investment in infrastructure to be delivered across various Federal Government institutions across the country, which is a commitment of the Buhari administration as a driver for economic growth and prosperity,” he stated. The minister argued that the Federal Government projects were visible assets which were proof of what Nigeria’s resources are invested in, from its earned resources and borrowings. Fashola said that the project was part of the Federal Government intervention on internal roads reconstruction. He advised those accusing President Muhammadu Buhari-led government of non-performance to listen to some of the feedbacks from the various sectors where this type of intervention had taken place. “This is consistent with our progressive ideal of improving human condition and that process continues here today as we hand over the rehabilitated road to Bayero University Kano,” he said. Fashola said that during the construction, more than 161 people were employed in the process, thereby contributing to the job creation initiatives of the government. He expressed the hope that the university would ensure that the asset is properly used and not abused. The Vice Chancellor of the Bayero University Kano (BUK), Prof. Sagir Adamu-Abbas, said the Ministry of Works and Housing has awarded the contract for the installation of 7.5 MVA, 33KVA/11KVA and 5.0MVA, 33 KVA/11KVA to improve power supply in the institution. “Apart from all those listed above, the ministry has also awarded a contract of over N400 million rehabilitation of more roads within the university and which work will commence on them very soon. “Among the roads the Federal Government is currently constructing in higher institutions across the country under its special intervention, BUK has been a major beneficiary,” he said. Adamu-Abbas said that the roads were in bad condition before the intervention, but now, “the roads are undergoing rehabilitation, many thanks to the Federal Government and Ministry of Works and Housing for their good works.” (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
