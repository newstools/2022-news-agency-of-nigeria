Attacks on the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv have killed more than 50 people in one day, local authorities say. “In the last 24 hours alone, 53 bodies of our citizens murdered by the Russian aggressor have arrived at the city’s morgues,” Vyacheslav Chaus, the head of the military administration said. Chernihiv, located near the borders with Russia and Belarus, has been the target of a Russian onslaught since the beginning of the war. Authorities say the humanitarian situation is calamitous and that there has been heavy damage to electricity, water and gas supplies. He said further negotiations are planned for Thursday on a possible escape corridor through which civilians are to leave the city. Chaus added that no Russian forces were currently in the city. “I don’t want to send the children of the city to certain death. “The corridor will only take place if we reach an agreement,” he said. (dpa/NAN)(www.nannews.ng)
