Hunger Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who is serving time in a Tbilisi prison after an illegal border crossing, on Thursday announced the end of his hunger strike. He said this was upon a request from Georgian fighters in Ukraine. The ex-leader went on hunger strike for the first time after his arrest in Georgia on Oct. 1, 2021, which lasted until Nov. 20 of the same year. He was later hospitalised, after which he announced the resumption of his hunger strike on Feb. 21. “I received a letter from Georgian fighters who have been protecting Ukraine since 2014, of whom I am very proud and friends. “They asked me to stop my hunger strike and join the fight in full force as soon as possible. “The same request comes from representatives of the supreme command of Ukraine, with whom I am in constant contact. Therefore, on the 20th day, I will stop my hunger strike. “Now we need common sense, health and full mobilisation, and strength instead of weakness. We must meet the victory in full readiness,’’ Saakashvili wrote on Facebook. The former president was put in jail shortly after returning to Georgia last fall where he was wanted on several charges. The charges included abuse of power, stealing public money, and ordering a crackdown on a peaceful rally. Saakashvili was the president of Georgia for two consecutive terms from 2008 to 2013 and was barred from seeking a third term under the Georgian constitution. Shortly after the end of his term, Saakashvili left the country. (Sputnik/NAN)
