Fuel prices were increased again in India Wednesday for the eighth time in the last nine days. According to a price notification of state fuel retailers, in the capital city of Delhi, petrol and diesel prices were hiked by INR 0.80 a litre respectively. A litre of petrol in Delhi now costs INR 101.01 (1.33 dollars) and diesel is sold at INR 92.27 (1.22 dollars) per litre. In Mumbai city, petrol is retailed at INR 115.88 (1.53 dollars) a litre, while diesel is being sold at INR 100.10 (1.32 dollars) per litre. The fuel rates are highest in Mumbai among India’s metropolitan cities. The prices vary across Indian states due to value-added tax or local taxation. Fuel rates were steady for over four months in the country in spite of the spike in crude oil prices. The rate revision ended on March 22. (Xinhua/NAN)
