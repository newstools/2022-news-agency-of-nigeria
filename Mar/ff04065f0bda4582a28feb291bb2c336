By Hassana Yakubu The Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation has condemned the terror attack on a  Kaduna-bound passenger train on Monday. The Managing Director of the Foundation, Alhaji Abubakar Gambo, said in a statement in Kaduna that with the attack it meant that there was hardly anywhere in the country that was safe. He said that it was a matter of serious concern that  security breaches were happening at a time that the government was assuring the public that it was on top of the situation. The foundation called on the Federal Government and relevant agencies to be more vigilant and to ensure that the ugly incident did not occur again. “We urged the authorities to ensure that the wounded are given proper medical attention while families of those who lost their lives are adequately compensated, Gambo advised in the statement. The foundation commiserated with the families of those who were killed in the attack and sympathized with those who were hurt. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
