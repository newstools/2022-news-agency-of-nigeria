By Ikenna Osuoha The Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen, on Tuesday, called for team work and commitment by stakeholders to end HIV epidemics. She made the call while declaring open the 6th National Council on AIDS in Abuja, with the theme: “Innovative Approaches Toward HIV Epidemic Control and Programme Sustainability at State Level.” She said women and girls were at the centre of HIV response with the rise in rape and other forms of Gender-Based Violence (GBV).
