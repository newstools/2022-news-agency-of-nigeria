The Managing Director of the HMO, Mr Lekan Ewenla, gave the task in a statement on Wednesday, in Abuja after its Annual General Meeting (AGM). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the new board members include Dr Minapuye Bob-Manuel, Medical Director of Valentine Hospitals in Port-Harcourt; Alhaji Abdulaziz Mashi-Abdullahi, a retired federal permanent secretary; and Mrs Susan Giwa-Osagie, an Independent Nin-Exe utive Director of Regency NEM Insurance, Ghana. According to the statement, the new members will replace three retiring directors who have completed their terms of office. The appointment of the three new board members were ratified by the shareholders of the company at the AGM. “They should support in driving the vision of the organisation. “That is by focusing on the enhancement of the existing operational processes and procedures that would further concretise the growth and the expansion strategy of the company. “This is with a clearer view of the future of health insurance programme and the implementation of business models that will stand the organisation out in the industry and the country,” he charged them.
