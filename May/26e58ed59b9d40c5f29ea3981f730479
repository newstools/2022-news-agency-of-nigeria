Russian President Vladimir Putin Russian forces said they attacked a Ukrainian engine factory and several railway stations during heavy air strikes overnight. “High-precision air and sea-launched missiles were used to destroy the production halls of the Motor Sich factory, which builds aircraft engines for the Ukrainian armed forces. “This includes four unmanned drones,’’ Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Wednesday. According to him, the railway station of the urban settlement of Pokrovsk in the Dnipropetrovsk region was also hit by missiles. The target here was a troop transport of reservists on their way to the Donbas region. Near the front, several command posts and communication centres in the Bakhmut area and a logistics centre in the Soledar area were attacked, Konashenkov said. Meanwhile, air force and army pilots had killed more than 300 Ukrainian soldiers and disabled 46 military vehicles, he said. This information could not be independently verified.
