Eight more cabinet ministers were sworn in before Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Monday, as a new government takes off amid weeks of political instability and economic crisis. According to a presidential spokesperson, the eight ministers took oaths at the President’s House in Colombo and later assumed duties in their respective ministries. Douglas Devananda was sworn in as the minister of fisheries, Keheliya Rambukwella as the minister of water supply, Mahinda Amaraweera as the minister of agriculture, wildlife and forest conservation, and Ramesh Pathirana as the industries minister. 13 cabinet ministers had been appointed on two previous occasions following the appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as the prime minister on May 12. Sri Lanka has seen weeks of public protests due to a shortage in essential supplies including food and medicines. (Xinhua/NAN) (www.nannews.ng) ======= Edited by Ummul Idris
