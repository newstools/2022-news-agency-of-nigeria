By Ijeoma Okigbo Leke Oyede, coach of Nigeria’s Senior Women’s Cricket team, said the team would focus on game awareness ahead of the Kwibuka 2022 Cricket tournament. Oyede said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday, as the team resumed camp in Benin ahead of the event in Kigali, Rwanda. Team Nigeria are expected to face top sides like Brazil, Germany, among others, in the event but Oyede says focus on game awareness will help the girls soak up pressure where necessary. “One of the things we are going to be looking at is the game knowledge and awareness. It is how to give a good measure of the acts and scenes on the pitch, which will help them win games. “This will help them absolve pressure when the need arises. So, we are going to engage them with matches against some male teams here in Benin and see how to keep them with a positive mindset,” he said. The erstwhile cricketer also added that the team would work on its fitness and improve on the gains of their last outing at the Nigeria Women’s T20I Invitational in March in Lagos. A total of 18 players were invited to camp on Friday ahead of the 8-team tournament beginning from June 9 to June 20. The eighth edition of the event, is in memory of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
