By Isaac Aregbesola CLAIM: The news about purported sack of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, began to trend early on Wednesday. The social media was awashed with news, trending in various WhatsApp groups. Some online media houses had, earlier published unconfirmed reports of the purported sack of the CBN governor by President Muhammadu Buhari. https://economicconfidential.com/2022/05/just-buhari-sacks-cbn/ https://thestreetjournal.org/just-in-buhari-relieves-godwin-emefiele-of-his-job-as-cbn-governor/ <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45379" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CBN-governor.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-45381" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/CBN-gov.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" /> Verification: However, The CBN has, however, debunked the rumour, stressing that news about the purported sack of its governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, was untrue. Osita Nwanisiobi, CBN ‘s Head of Corporate Communications, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday that he was not aware of the sack. NAN gathered that the Emefiele was presently out of the country on official assignment. “The Governor left to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland immediately after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) briefing,” a staff of the bank said. Presidential Villa where the purported sacked would have emanated from also denied knowledge of the sack. Emefiele has been under public scrutiny since he declared interest to run for presidency in the forthcoming, 2023 elections. Condemnations have trailed his involvement in politics, with experts saying it could jeopardise the integrity of the country’s financial system.   Verdict:  The claim is FALSE. The CBN as of the time of filing the report denied knowledge of the sack of  its governor. President Buhari has not sacked Emefiele as the CBN Governor
