World football governing body FIFA on Monday fined the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) 150,000 Swiss Francs (CHF) following fans’ misconduct on March 29 in Abuja. Displeased football fans had vandalised facilities at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium after the Super Eagles’ 1-1 draw with the Black Stars of Ghana. The result, which helped Ghana to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup on away goal rule, ended Nigeria’s hope of qualification for the mundial in Qatar this November. The sanction is with regard to article 16 of FIFA disciplinary code, which deals with “order and security at matches (failure to implement existing safety rules and failure to ensure that law and order are maintained in the stadium, invasion of the field of play and throwing of objects). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in addition to the fine, which is about N64 million, Nigeria is also to play one match without spectators.(NAN)
