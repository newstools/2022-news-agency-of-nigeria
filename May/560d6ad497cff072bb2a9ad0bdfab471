By Martha Nyam Mr Caleb Mutfwang, People’s Democratic Party (PDP)’s governorship candidate in Plateau, has said that there was hope in the horizon for the North-Central state. Mutfwang stated this in an interview with newsmen in Jos on Thursday shortly after he defeated 14 others to clinch the ticket. “It is quite humbling to be entrusted with the responsibility of being the flag bearer of the PDP in Plateau state. I do not take this for granted. “I want to assure the people of Plateau that there is hope in the horizon; by the grace of God, when PDP returns to power, we will lift the state to a higher level than where it is today. “I believe the people of Plateau are yearning for the return of PDP. We will work to ensure this happens,” he said. Mutfwang said that the outcome of the primaries would be best described as a no-victor no-vanquished contest, while calling on other contestants to work with him toward ensuring victory at the polls in 2023. He added that the primaries, which he described as free and fair, represented a sign of good things the state would soon experience. He called on the Plateau PDP family to unite and go into the 2023 election as a united force. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) ======== Edited by AbdulFatai Beki and Ephraims Sheyin
