By Jacinta Nwachukwu SunPawa Energy Ltd, an indigenous energy firm, says it will provide 30,000 Solar Home Systems (SHS) in the six geopolitical zones of the country. Mr Odera Ozoka, Chief Executive Officer of the firm told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview in Abuja on Wednesday that the aim was to bring relief to the people living especially in the rural communities. Ozoka listed Adamawa, Anambra, Kaduna, Kwara, Kogi and Delta as the pilot states where the products would be rolled out, while other states would be visited two years from now. “SunPawa is looking at bringing solutions in the renewable energy space and this will go a long way in bringing relief to a lot of people living in darkness, especially in the rural communities. “At the moment, just under half of the population in Nigeria is living without any electricity and of those, 75 per cent are mostly found in the rural communities. “As entrepreneurs, we look for creative ways to ensure that people have access to reliable electricity thereby increasing Nigerians economic growth exponentially,’’ he said. He reiterated his readiness towards ensuring that more people have access to electricity in the country, adding that though it might not be easy; given the structural problems in the power sector. SunPawa Energy was recently shortlisted by Rural Electrification Agency for the Solar Home System Output Based Funds component under the Nigerian Electrification Project to provide nationwide energy access to rural communities.
