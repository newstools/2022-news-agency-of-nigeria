By Fortune Abang Xu Guixiang, spokesperson for the Regional Government in Northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has commended mutual relationship shared among religious faithful during Ramadan. Xu made this known at a virtual conference on the backdrop of the just concluded Ramadan festivity in Xinjiang, in China. According to him, Muslim faithful and religious personalities in the region shared remarkable experiences during the recently concluded Islamic holy month of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. Xu said, “From April 3 to May 2, Muslims of various ethnic groups in the region observed Ramadan. “They celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which fell on May 3, while enjoying a one-day holiday.” He quoted Memet Juma, Hatip of the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar Prefecture, to have said that faithful visited the 550-year-old Mosque daily and thousands of people from different ethnic groups performed their traditional dances on the square in front of the Mosque. The spokesperson described Xinjiang as home to various ethnic groups and religious beliefs. Xu also quoted Zumrat Obul, Head of the Regional United Front Work Department, as saying that all normal religious activities were protected by law. According to him, in recent years there has been a great misunderstanding about the religious situation in Xinjiang. He alleged that the United States in particular had groundlessly claimed religious freedom was restricted in Xinjiang. “These ridiculous lies runs completely counter to the facts. “We would like to go on telling Xinjiang’s true stories to the international community. “We are also looking forward to welcoming more visitors to Xinjiang, who can witness the prosperous and comfortable life here,” he added.
