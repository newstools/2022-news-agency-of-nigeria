By Monday Ijeh Chief Onyemuche Nnamani, a Commissioner with the Police Service Commission (PSC), has urged the newly promoted female Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs) to motivate youths in the South East to join the Police. Nnamani, who represents the South East in the Commission, made the call while addressing newsmen on Tuesday, in Abuja. He said the promotion of the two female officers from the South East, Ngozi Onadeko and  Josephine Nna to AIG, signaled a brighter future for the region. Onadeko is currently the Commissioner of Police in charge of Oyo State while Nna is in charge of Anti Trafficking unit, Force Criminal Investigation Department. The commissioner also congratulated John Amadi on his confirmation as Deputy Inspector General of Police, statutorily representing the South East in the Police management team. Nnamani said the promotions had disproved those claiming marginalisation of the region and would motivate the youths to take up career in the Nigeria Police. He therefore enjoined the newly promoted officers to be good ambassadors of the people and Nigeria. According to him, policing is a noble profession that should attract the best from across the country, including the South East. (NAN) Edited by Maharazu Ahmed/Isaac Aregbesola
