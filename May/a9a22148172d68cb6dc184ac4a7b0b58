By Ahmed Ubandoma First Lady Aisha Buhari has commiserated with the government and people of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the demise of their 16th President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, who died at the age of 73. The First Lady offered her condolences on Friday, when she led members of the first family, friends and well-wishers to the UAE Embassy in Abuja. She was received by the UAE Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr Fahad Al Taffaq. While sympathising with the government and people of the emirate on behalf of the first family, she described Zayed as a visionary leader. She also described his death as a loss, not only to the UAE but the entire global community. Buhari, therefore, prayed to almighty God to grant the deceased eternal rest and give  members of his immediate family and the entire country the fortitude to bear the loss. Responding on behalf of the UAE, the ambassador expressed gratitude to the First Lady for identifying with them in their moment of grief. Al Taffaq expressed confidence that the existing cordial bilateral relations between Nigeria and the UAE would continue to flourish for the mutual benefits of both countries (NAN) Edited by Mark Longyen/Ismail AbdulAziz
