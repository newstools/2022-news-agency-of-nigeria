By Bridget Ikyado An All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial aspirant in Benue, Rev. Hyacinth Alia, says if given the chance to govern the state, he will reposition it to become industrial and commercial hub for Africa. Alia said this in his remarks at his 56th birthday celebration organised by a group, Alia Alliance, on Monday, in Abuja. The clergy said that the revamping of the industrial sector was necessary to reduce unemployment, crime and youth restiveness. “I will set up more industries, factories to absorb some of our youth roaming around the streets without jobs,” he added. According to him, his focus will also be to harness the state’s agricultural potentials to accelerate industrial and commercial development of the state. Alia said that he would provide the effective and competent leadership the state required to address its myriads of challenges that stippled its development. “These challenges that perennially beset the state cut across all sectors, spanning from education, economic development, healthcare delivery, agriculture and associated industries, social security, insecurity  amongst others. “If given the mandate in the 2023 election, I will ensure the sectors of agriculture, education, and health among others be restored the lost glories of the state,” the governorship aspirant said. Alia urged the people of Benue to continue to pray for a successful election and emergence of good leaders for the state. The governorship aspirant commended the alliance for the wide publicity and assistance it had been given to his campaign. In his response, Mr Jimmy Ajim of the Alia Alliance, assured the governorship hopeful of the group’s support to ensure he obtained the APC ticket and ultimately win the governorship election.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng)   ======= Edited y Isaac Aregbesola
