By Sumaila Ogbaje National Centre for Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) has called for closer collaboration with Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to mop-up illegal arms in Nigeria. National Coordinator of NCCSALW, Retired Maj.-Gen. Abba Dikko, made the call during a courtesy call on the Commandant-General of NSCDC, Dr Ahmed Audi, at the NSCDC headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday. Dikko said that NCCSALW had been working assiduously to deliver on its mandate. He said the centre was willing and ready to work with NSCDC and other security agencies to ensure that the illegal arms in possession of unauthorised people were recovered in order to restore law and order in the country. The coordinator commended the NSCDC boss for his leadership, innovation and direction, particularly in the area of protection of critical infrastructure and national assets. He called for partnership with NSCDC in the areas of intelligence sharing, data collection and mainstreaming control of arms in the NSCDC’s hierarchy and work environment. According to him, leveraging the existing capacities of NSCDC and other security agencies will go a long way in strengthening coordination and building the capacity of relevant stakeholders on their responsibilities under the small arms and light weapons management paradigm. Responding, the NSCDC boss lauded the establishment of the centre, saying that it was in the interest of peace and security as well as crime prevention and control. He thanked the coordinator and his team for their efforts toward achieving the centre’s mandate. Audi expressed delight with the opportunity to support NCCSALW in the discharge of its duties of mopping of illicit arms in the country. The commandant-general expressed NSCDC’s readiness to give full support to the centre, saying that the fight against illicit arms in the polity was a must and could only be won through collaboration with relevant stakeholders.
