The children said that the call became necessary because of some identified  challenges  affecting them  which included child labour, child marriage, out-of-school children, insecurity, healthcare, mental health and child abuse. Others are gender inequality, limited access to education, school dropouts and discrimination . They tasked the government on provision of medical supplies and compensation for doctors to address health challenges of children. They also called for a child-friendly justice system and an increase in budgetary allocation for children’s healthcare. The children called for stronger laws against children sexual abuse while rehabilitation should be provided for affected ones. They urged the government and NGO’s to campaign against all forms of abuse on children to help prevent molestation. The children said that report centres should be effective so children could talk about abuse that affected them and  there should be intervention for children who were  victims of abuse, neglect and exploitation. They said this would strengthen child protection systems, including children’s homes where they could receive care. “There should be legislation and implementation of the Child Rights Act (CRA) and free education for all. “Awareness on the consequences of early marriage which alters the course of a girl’s life and her potential should be raised. “Parents should be encouraged to take their children to school and false myths on western education should be shunned. “Leaders should create an enabling environment for education and government should invest more in education for out-of-school children.’’ The children said that quality of education should be improved while parents needed to improve knowledge and commitment to contribute to enrolling their children in school at the right age and time. They said that security agents should be equipped with tools to protect children from attack and stronger security strategies should be carried out in affected areas. They added that  to help in preventing attacks on schools, cattle ranching policy should be implemented to prevent cattle-herder crises and more security personnel should be deployed to affected areas. The children said that there was need to raise  awareness in rural areas  and religious leaders about educating girls with the  provision of  enough schools for girls to attend . They called for free education and adequate teaching personnel to be provided as well. They also said that an agency should be directed to ensure attendance of children in schools during school hours while there should be provision of disability care canters and  discrimination should be discouraged. They appealed to the Nigerian government to fulfill its commitment to increase education funding and ensure that states and their local government also invested in education. Mr Amanuel Mamo, Director, Advocacy and Campaigns, SCI, Nigeria said that Children’s Day celebration was another opportunity for the organisations to celebrate children. Mamo called upon stakeholders at Federal, State and Local Government Areas (LGAs) to renew their commitments to protect, respect and fulfil the rights of the child as articulated in the Child Rights Act (2003). “Having the opportunity to listen to these children over the last two days is a reason, more than enough, to celebrate children. ”If the future is at hand, therefore, we are given historical opportunity and responsibility to shape and paint the futures as bright as we want it to be. “The smart thing to do to paint the future is to invest in children.‘’ Mamo called  upon the states yet to pass the Child Protection Bill to prioritise the adoption and enforcement of the Child Rights Act (2003). He called  for a stronger collaboration, coordination and cooperation between all relevant stakeholders, including the government, the private sector, donors, civil society organisations, NGOs, communities and the media. This is to ensure no child is left behind or excluded from the opportunity to survive, learn and be protected from all forms of abuse and violence, simply because of gender, disability, cultural practices or other structural barriers.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by Idris Abdulrahman
