Eat foods that are low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Include a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. Exercise regularly.” Ikokwu, however, advised elders to make physical activity a part of their everyday life. “Do things you like; for example, take a brisk walk, ride a bicycle, or go swimming. “Talk with your health care provider if you haven’t been exercising and you want to start a vigorous programme or increase your physical activity. “If you have had a stroke in the past, it’s important to reduce your risk of a second stroke.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that May is the month of Stroke awareness.
