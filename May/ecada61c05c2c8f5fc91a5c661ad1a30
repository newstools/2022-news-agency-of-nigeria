Adamu is harmonious in spite of their political differences. “And that is why I tell whoever cares to listen that when you see any political issue between myself and Sen. Adamu, stay out of it. “Whatever happens you will never understand what is in between us and above all as I mentioned earlier, there are two pieces of advice that he gave me in the past that was meaningful to me and shall continue to be meaningful to me.” Earlier, the former Secretary to the Nasarawa State Government, Dr Zainab Ahmed Tanko, also extolled the virtues of Sen. Adamu, who she described as her mentor. She commended Adamu for his contributions to the creation of Nasarawa State and his efforts towards ensuring that the state has a sense of direction since inception. In attendance at the event were the serving and immediate past former Speakers of Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Nasarawa State APC Chairman, Mr John Mamman, Local Government Chairmen of Karu, Nasarawa and Keffi, among other stakeholders.
