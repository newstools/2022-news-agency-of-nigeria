By Ginika Okoye The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) says it is collaborating with the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB) to address crucial issues of data protection. Mr Babatunde Irukera, the Chief Executive Officer of FCCPC, said this in a statement in Abuja on Friday. Irukera said the collaboration would ensure that consumers and businesses derived the protection and benefits that were inherent in economic expansion that technology and digital markets enhanced. He said the partnership had culminated into the establishment of a Joint Enforcement Desk (JED) to ensure effective consumers’ data protection. ”In 2019, the Federal Government of Nigeria enacted the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), in furtherance of prevailing national and international instruments and protocols to protect citizens. ”In February 2022, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (Bureau), was created as an enforcement mechanism of the NDPR. ”Key mandates of the Commission include protection of consumers, their privacy, enforcement of enactments (including NDPR) for such protection; as well as regulating competition, including appropriation of data. ”In this regard the Commission and Bureau have established a Joint Enforcement Desk (JED),” Irukera said He said that both agencies acknowledged that digital markets would strengthen economies and could promote shared prosperity where properly regulated.
